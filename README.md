## Introduction
This project is conducted as part of a linguistic research initiative under a research assistantship at the University of British Columbia (UBC). It focuses on examining the semantic evolution of the term "community" within public discourse. The methodology leverages advanced web scraping techniques, employing tools such as Selenium to aggregate news articles from prestigious English-language publications, including The New York Times and The Guardian.

## Objectives
- To collect extensive datasets from eminent news websites for linguistic analysis.
- To dissect these datasets meticulously, identifying diachronic shifts in the connotation and application of the term "community."
