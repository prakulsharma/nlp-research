The Community Reinvestment Act and Regulation BB,The American Banker,"January 31, 1979, Wednesday","This record is then to be taken into account by the regulator in evaluation of any application for charter, deposit insurance, branch, other deposit facility, acquisition, or merger or any bank holding company application.It is interesting to examine the records of the committee hearings held while the act was under consideration. Generally, supporters of the act gave four reasons why the act should be passed.First, it was assumed that financial institutions rather than the Government should play the leading role in providing capital required by local communities in meeting housing and economic development needs. Second, as recipient of a public charter, a bank, savings and loan, or other financial institution was considered to have a responsibility to its community to provide adequate capital to meet the economic needs of that community.Third, studies have shown that financial institutions to a significant degree have shunned the credit needs of their local neighborhoods, especially if these neighborhoods are of low- or moderate-income character and are located near the central city.Often deposit funds are taken from these neighborhoods and reinvested in mortgages in suburban areas. Fourth, and perhaps most important, there was a feeling on the part of many in Congress that the Federal regulatory agencies, in evaluating applications, have not given sufficient weight to the need for credit services in a community as well as the need for deposit services.In summary, it was the feeling on the part of many, that the Community Reinvestment Act merely reasserts longstanding policy that had been ignored by the regulators. This policy is, simply, that that the convenience and needs criteria used in evaluating an application also include credit needs.Those opposing the act did so primarily on the basis that authority already existed that could be used by the regulatory agencies in encouraging financial institutions to meet the credit needs of their local communities. It was pointed out that the bill might impose a significant additional burden in administrative processes and paperwork on banks and other institutions. Opponents feared that the act would limit the ability of financial institutions to generate needed funds for loans in their primary service areas since often these funds are obtained through loan participations in lines of credit with correspondents in other areas. Opponents also expressed the concern that the act would be a major step toward allocation of credit since it would substitute the judgment of a Federal agency for that of a financial institution determining what constitutes a legitimate credit need. The act is not very specific; for example, it does not define ""community"" or ""low- and moderate-income neighborhoods."" It required the Federal regulatory agencies to draft a regulation by November 6, 1978, that would make explicit the responsibilities of financial institutions in complying with the Community Reinvestment Act.The Federal Reserve Board regulation implementing the Community Reinvestment Act has been designated Regulation BB. It applies only to state-chartered banks that are members of the Federal Reserve System. However, it is virtually identical to the regulations issued by the other Federal regulatory agencies that apply to other financial institutions.The new Regulation BB went into effect November 6, 1978. It can be divided into three main parts: first, a bank's duty under the act; second, the duties of the Federal Reserve banks in evaluating state member banks' performance under the act; and third, the duties of the Federal Reserve System in considering applications.Under Regulation BB the first step a bank must take is to determine its own community or communities. The bank may have more than one community, depending on the number of offices or branches. Three bases may be used by a bank in defining its own community. First, it may use the boundaries of a standard metropolitan statistical area (SMSA) or county, adusted for adjacent areas it wishes to serve; and if the bank is small, its community can be part of a county or SMSA. Usually, the community will not be larger than a county or SMSA for a bank having only one office. Second, a bank's community may be its effective lending territory and other areas equidistant from each of the bank's offices, circular in shape. A bank located in a downtown area would be prohibited from excluding low-and moderate-income neighborhoods near its main office while including wealthier areas located greater distances from the central city. Third, a bank can use any basis that meets the purpose of the CRA, does not exclude low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, and is not based on arbitrary criteria.The regulation requires that the bank define its community by using a map, that it be approved by the board of directors of the bank and reviewed at least annually, and that the map be made part of the bank's Community Reinvestment Act Statement.The second requirement placed on banks by Regulation BB is that by February 4, 1979, they prepare a Community Reinvestment Act Statement, which must be adopted and reviewed and updated annually by a bank's board of directors. The CRA Statement must include a map showing the bank's community or communities, a list of the principal types of credit the bank is prepared to extend to its community, and a copy of the Community Reinvestment Act Notice that is outlined in the regulation.A bank should include on its list only those types of loans it definitely plans to make available within its community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. Its performance under the act will be judged according to its effectiveness in actually providing these services. Examples of the types of services that may be provided and the specificity with which they should be listed are residential loans for one to four dwelling units, housing rehabilitation loans, home improvement loans, small business loans, agricultural loans, consumer loans, and so on.Banks are encouraged also to include in their CRA Statement materials on how the bank is helping to meet its community's credit needs, periodic reports on how it has actually helped to meet those needs during the past year, and details about how community credit needs were ascertained.The CRA statement must be kept at the head office of the bank, and if the bank has one or more branches, the statement dealing with the local community of each branch must be kept at the branch office. Copies of a CRA Statement must be furnished, should they be requested, to any individual or group without charge other than for ordinary copying.A bank must post in its lobby the Com munity Reinvestment Act Notice contained in the regulation. The notice describes the act, tells where a customer can obtain the bank's CRA statement and where written comments concerning the bank's performance under the act may be sent, indicates that a customer can examine all letters received by the bank in the past two years concerning its performance and that comments received by the local Federal Reserve Bank concerning the bank's CRA performance can be examined, and indicates how announcements of applications dealing with firms covered by the Community Reinvestment Act may be requested from the local Reserve Bank. If the bank is a subsidiary of a bank holding company, the notice must also provide that fact and that the bank's CRA performance will be taken into account in all holding company applications.Files relating to the Community Reinvestment Act available for public inspection must contain al signed written community Reinvestment Act statement or its performance under the act. Responses to such letters may be included in the files; however, material harmful to any person's good name or reputation and letters that relate only to a particular credit application should not be included. *T""The Community Reinvestment Act and Regulation BB call for a careful and ongoing assessment on the part of both regulators and bankers of a bank's role in meeting the credit needs of it entire community.""The second part of Regulation BB deals with the responsibility of the Federal Reserve Bank in assessing the record of performance under the Community Reinvestment Act of a state member bank. The responsibility of other Federal regulators in assessing the record of performance of their banks is identical.A bank's performance under the Community Reinvestment Act will be evaluated as part of the regular examination process. In the Eleventh Federal Reserve District, this assessment will take place during the bank's consumer affairs examination.Examiners are instructed to determine whether the Community reinvestment Act notice has been placed in the lobby, to review the bank's CRA statement and any signed written comments received by the bank or by the Reserve Bank, and to determine that appropriate files are being kept by the bank.Examiners will make an assessment of the bank's performance under the CRA, giving consideration to the following factors:1. Activities undertaken by the bank to determine the credit needs of its local community, including the extent of the bank's efforts to communicate with members of the community regarding credit services offered by the bank.2. Marketing and credit-related programs to make the community aware of the credit services offered.3. The extent of participation of the bank's board of directors in formulating policies and reviewing performance.4. Evidence that the bank actually encourages applications for the types of credit it has listed in its CRA statement. Any efforts by the bank to discourage applicants from applying for any of the types of credit it is claiming to provide to the community will be considered a negative factor.5. Geographic distribution of a bank's credit extensions, credit applications, and denials.6. Evidence of discrimination or other illegal credit practices, including any violations of either the Equal Credit Opportunity Act or the Fair Housing Act.7. The bank's record of opening and closing offices and providing services at these offices, in order to determine whether each office is providing appropriate credit services to its local community.8. Participation in local community development and redevelopment programs.9. Origination or purchase of residential mortgage loans, home improvement loans, and small business or small farm loans within the community.10. Participation in Government-insured, -- guaranteed, or -- subsidized loan programs for housing, small businesses, or small farms.11. The ability of the bank to meet the community credit needs, given the bank's size, financial condition, various legal restrictions, local economic factors, and other variables.12. Any other factors that bear on whether the bank is meeting the credit needs of the entire community, including low-neighborhoods.Obviously, a bank will not have to score well on all these factors in order to receive a favorable assessment.If the examiners conclude that a bank is not adequately meeting the credit needs of its entire community, they will point out to the bank where they feel any shortcomings lie and encourage it to increase services in these areas. However, the act is not intended to force any bank into allocating credit or into making loans that are unsafe or unsound. It does not provide any specific penalties for noncompliance. It does provide, however, that a bank's record under the CRA be taken into account when a bank is involved in any application process that requires Federal approval.In the case of a bank holding company application, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System is required to consider the record under the Community Reinvestment Act of each subsidiary of the applicant bank holding company. In addition, the Board is required to consider each proposed subsidiary bank that has an officer, employee, or significant stockholder associated with the applicant. State banking departments may comment on the applications, and the Board must consider their views. Further, at the request of the applicant holding company, the Board can consider the record of nonbanking subsidiaries in meeting local community credit needs.The Community Reinvestment Act and Regulation BB call for a careful and ongoing assessment on the part of both regulators and bankers of a bank's role in meeting the credit needs of its entire community. Regular consultation with community groups is encouraged, to determine both the community's credit needs and the effectiveness of the bank's programs in meeting those needs."
C&S Community Loan Unit Set,The American Banker,"September 25, 1979, Tuesday","Mr. Bloom stated, ""It has always been our belief that C&S bank can prosper only as the community does. Our new department is an additional commitment to this philosophy.""The Community Banking Department will officially open in October and will be located at 33 North Ave. in the C&S Tower.One phase of the department will be administration of the City of Atlanta's Business Improvement Loan Program. For the past two years, C&S has acted as agent for the city in a public-private investment partnership which encourages property improvement financing in selected business revitalization areas in the city. Funds are chiefly provided through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development through Atlanta's Community Development Block Grant Program. It also utilizes resources from banks, savings and loan institutions, private development companies and the SBA.Businesses in eight Atlanta business districts are currently eligible for this type of financing: Lakewood Heights, Little Five Points, University West, Sweet Auburn, Peachtree Walk, Heart of Atlanta, Kirkwood, Fairlie-Poplar, Home Park and the McClendon-Clifton area.A second lending function to be housed in the bank's new department will be in-town mortgage financing. This area works to make credit availability for in-town homes consistent with that for surburban housing.The third type of financing to handled in the new department will be those loans made in the metropolitan Atlanta area in conjunction with the Small Business Administration."
Community Bank Seminar Slated,The American Banker,"December 4, 1979, Tuesday","The three-day agenda will address potential threats to bank earnings in the 1980s and the necessity for disciplined, tight controls with well-developed marketing plans for maintaining or increasing bank earnings.Topics to be discussed include spread control, deposit generation, pricing of bank services, Regulation Q planning, new product offerings, and introducing and managing NOW accounts. In addition, industry experts and bank presidents will present a blend of theiry and how-to applications in a format which includes panels, concurrent break-out sessions, and rap sessions.Spouses are invited to attend the CEO sessions and the specially planned ""Spouses Program Lectures.""Registration fee is $325 (BMA member discount fee, $275).

"Community Act Little Used, Heimann Says",The American Banker,"April 26, 1979, Thursday","Addressing a University of Chicago audience, the Comptroller said the ultimate effectiveness of CRA as a tool to halt urban blight rests with community groups, which can become more aggressive in urging greater participation by financial institutions in inner-city renewal.If CRA is to produce any benefits, he said, the real thrust should come from the community themselves because it is not likely to emanate from the financial institutions or their regulatory agencies.Since the law went into effect in November, commercial banks and thrifts have complained about the cost of CRA compliance, arguing also that the law is unnecessary and that it merely adds to an already excessive regulatory burden.In his remarks as a guest lecturer on the campus, the Comptroller said the vast majority of the nation's commercial banks ""seem to be taking CRA seriously"" and are ""doing what the law says.""However, he said, it may take as long as two years ""for the agencies and the bankers to get used to CRA."" He noted here is still much to be worked out over interpretations of CRA definitions of what constitutes a community and its legitimate credit needs.Nevertheless, the flow of requests from community groups for CRA statements from banks has been spotty, a result which he described as rather remarkable. He observed that maybe community groups have still not heard of CRA.What little CRA activity has occurred been in Chicago, New York, Philadelphia, Los Angeles and San Francisco.Despite what he called poor wording of CRa and innumerable problems of regulatory interpretation, CRA has invigorated elements of the banking industry to start responding to community group complaints over alleged redlining, he maintained.In some respects, CRA represents an ""exciting movement,"" since some banks have been forced for the first time ""to reach out to the public.""In reviewing CRA history, the Comptroller said only Illinois and New York deserve credit for getting CRA on the books. That is because the law was actively and successively promoted by community groups in those two states following years of redlining complaints.Curiously, he observed, both states have ""peculiar banking structures"" which are designed to limit competition and protect institutions.Nonetheless, community groups have a potential for using CRA more effectively, he maintained, if they constructively approach banks and savings and loan associations with the attitude: ""Hey, fellows, we're here to help you out with CRA.""The Comptroller said many banks and S&Ls will welcome suggestions from community groups on ways they can meet their CRA obligations, and meantime the law will serve to discover the truth between redlining charges of the neighborhood groups and denials by financial institutions.Mr. Heimann made his remarks in an afternoon lecture on ""Revitalizing Neighborhood Commercial Areas,"" sponsored by the University of Chicago's Center for Urban Studies.During a question session, Ronald Grzywinski, chairman of the executive committee of the $57.5 million-deposit South Shore National Bank of Chicago, urged the Comptroller to adopt a more aggressive ""incentivism"" posture on Regulation Q deposit-rate ceilings as one means of getting banks to invest in urban and rural redevelopment.Mr. Grzywinski, whose bank has long been an innovator in urban financing, called on Mr. Heimann to raise savings rate ceilings for individual banks on the basis of their performance in urban reinvestment.If a bank -- urban or rural -- does a good job of investing in renewal ventures, it should be rewarded by being able to pay savers higher rates than can its competitors, Mr. Grzywinski recommended.""If a bank does an exceptional job, then it could pay, say, 6% or 7% on savings,' Mr. Grzywinski declared, adding that the Comptroller and other regulators should not ""lose this one-time opportunity"" to provide profit incentives for banks to help in urban redevelopment.Responding negatively to the Chicago banker's suggestion, Mr. Heimann said he disagreed with the concept of holding Reg. Q ""hostage"" for social purposes.He said such a system would create ""distortions in financial markets"" and is ""no way to solve the problems"" of urban blight.Mr. Heimann, former New York State Superintendent of Banks, declared that three years ago the New York Legislature held the usury ceiling ""captive"" as a means of inducing financing institutions to grant more mortgages but the effort merely disrupted the financial system and delayed credit extensions.Mr. Grzywinski argued, however, that the regulatory agencies should be exploring innovative ways ""to use the resources of the private banking sector"" to help in urban renewal.The South Side Chicago banker, who was the only banking witness to testify before Congress in favor of CRA, said the job of curbing disinvestment is ""not getting done,"" in part because community groups -- rather than commercial banks and thrifts -- are left with the burden of proving CRA complaints."
S&Ls Get $187 Mil. Community Funds,The American Banker,"January 19, 1979, Friday","The CIF, announced in June, 1978, by President Carter and FHLBB chairman Robert H. McKinney, is designed to assist and encourage cooperative efforts among private financial institutions, community groups, and government agencies in revitalizing and developing the nation's urban and mature rural communities Over a five-year period, the CIF will provide $10 billion at below-market interest rates to S&Ls demonstrating involvement in and commitment to affirmative lending efforts inmature low- and moderate-income communities.The San Francisco FHLB will distribute a total of $1.87 billion during the five years --that qualify for CIF participation in the three-state 11th FHLB District. S&L requests for CIF funds exceeded the amount available in the first two quarterly offerings. Funds were allocated to the S&Ls in proportion to their requests.CIF funds are not used as direct subsidies, but rather reflect the current and planned involvement of the S&LS in community preservation and revitalization programs. The CIF funds received by S&LS permit them to expand their participation in community preservation and development activities.Among the government programs CIF participants are involved with are California Housing Finance Agency projects; Community Block Grant programs; the HOPE program in Los Angeles; various Department of Housing and Urban Development projects; local housing authority projects; and programs of a number of other agencies of the U.S. govenment.CIF participants are also involved in home loan counseling centers in several California cities; the Housing Conservation Institute in San Francisco; the Fair Housing Council; various local redevelopment agencies; the Savings Associations Mortgage Company; neighborhood housing services; and the Urban Reinvestment TAsk Force.Many S&Ls receiving CIF funds also act independently to meet the housing needs of low-to moderate-income families in urban and rural areas.The next CIF quarterly offering will be funded in January, 1979, when another $93.5 million will be allocated to eligible 11th District S&Ls."
Community Service Has Roots in Bank's History,The American Banker,"July 25, 1979, Wednesday","When our bank was young, and our community was young, banking activities included support of such businesses as barge building for the Erie Canal and helping young, Mohawk Valley farmers grow and thrive. Today our purpose has remained steadfast, and although the original Canal has passed into history, Oneida National Bank continues to support a wide range of businesses. Some are as new as the manufacturing of fiberglass tub inclosures and some are as time-honored as forging copper and brass. We still continue to help the farmers of upstate New York, as one of the state's primary farm lenders with $30 million in agricultural loans.At present, we are the largest independent bank in upstate New York. Although our main office is in Utica, we now are the home town bank in seven counties serving small cities, towns, villages and rural regions.We serve each of our communities (which are very diverse) with special and individual attention to their needs. To do business this way means that programs have to be tailored to specific communities and that our employees have to be well attuned to activities in the places where we do business.Oneida National has never confused thinking on the individual or community level with thinking small; we have made expansion moves at the appropriate times, and we are continually adding new services to help our customers.Our philosophy of responsive community service is best explained by example. Because we serve such a wide range of communities, we instituted a program called Suburban Banking Service in the mid-1960s. By using a specially-equipped vehicle and small, permanent building in each location, we were able to bring banking services to the small communities of Sauquoit, Oriskany and North Rome -- areas that had no existing banking facilities. The offices consisted of a colonial style wood frame building which served as the bank lobby. An overhead door in the rear of the building was raised to provide access to the bus. All banking was actually done inside the 26 foot vehicle. This bus was equipped with teller counters, an office, a telephone and a two way radio to keep in touch with the main office. At two of the three locations, it was proved that there was enough traffic to warrant a full time permanent office, so, in Oriskany and Sauquoit, new offices were erected. This is one way in which we have, through the years, tried to serve our community's special needs.We also serve two popular resort communities -- Old Forge in the Adirondack Mountains and Syivan Beach on one of the state's largest inland lakes, Oneida Lake. In serving these communities, their special needs have been considered. Both branches are open on Saturdays throughout the summer months to serve the many vacationers from our bank service area who visit these scenic regions. Unlike many resort-town banks that experience a drain on funds at the end of the summer, many of the people that bank with us during the summer maintain accounts and deposit balances with us at these branches throughout the year.The opening of our SyIvan Beach office, in 1971, represented a unique opportunity, since our bank responded to a request from the citizens of SyIvan Beach asking us to come to their community. SyIvan Beach is a community now enjoying a community renewal and the oneida National Bank has been instrumental in the financing of the projects that will rejuvenate this old, established resort village.Part of the reason we feel that we can keep abreast on the activities of 33 different locations is that for the most part, our employees are residents of the areas which we serve. Beyond that, Oneida National Bank emphasizes community involvement for all of its employees. A survey of employees which we undertook two years ago determined that our employees were donating literally thousands of hours to community activities ranging from the Girl Scouts and Salvation Army to the boards of major hospitals and industrial development councils.Our banking hours are tailored to our customers needs, too. We were the first bank in our area to offer 8 a.m. drivein window service and the first also to replace ""bankers hours"" with ""customer"" hours by providing teller service until 5:00 p.m. in all offices and, of course, later on Thursdays and Fridays.The Oneida National Bank, as one of the prime sponsors of the local Urban Housing Program, has sought to prevent urban decay and to establish revitalization for home acquisition by low-to moderate-income families.Acting in the capacity of lead bank, the Oneida National Bank has encouraged other lenders to be supportive of the local Neighborhood Housing Service Program. This new housing concept, a program of revitalizing the inner city through renovation, is an attempt to prevent urban decay by working in partnership with city government and neighborhood groups. Not only is the Oneida National Bank a supporter to the lending function, but it is a contributor to the start-up costs and the continuing three-year operating costs of the program.Within the downturn urban renewal area of Utica, construction of a new hotel has begun in which the Oneida National Bank is a one-third participant in both interim and long-term financing. EXtensive renovations and additions to the area's two major hospitals have been made with the various financial institutions participating, again with the Oneida National Bank serving as lead bank.Within the area of servicing the needs of the numerous senior citizens' housing centers, associations for retarded childeren, domiciliary homes and religious and fraternal groups, the Oneida National Bank, again as lead bank, has recently participated in the financing of a church in a depressed area for a minority group. This represented literally 100% financing and is a ""first"" in banking circles in the Mohawk Valley. In no less than four municipalities within the community, the Oneida National Bank is working with local housing authorities and the Farmers Home Administration to provide interim financing for the construction, renovation or expansion of housing for the senior citizen.Through daily contact with numerous business customers, account officers are constantly made aware of the needs of the entire community -- business, municipal, county, fraternal, religious and social.Active relationships are maintained with the Small Business Administration, Economic Development Authority, Job Development Authority Industrial Development Corporations and New York State Business Development Corp. Presently, Oneida National Bank officers serve as officers and/or directors of Utica Industrial Development Corp., Rome Industrial Development Corp., Oneida County Industrial Development Corp., Herkimer County Industrial Development Corp., and the New York State Business Development Corp.Notably, the Oneida National Bank is presently one of but two banks in New York State chosen by the SBA to participate in a pilot program, the purpose of which is to improve SBA loan servicing through greater reliance on bank investigations and decisions. Affirmative approaches to the creation and retention of jobs within the community are exemplified by credit recently granted, in cooperation with the Federal Economic Development Authority guarantee program,which enabled a major manufacturing concern within the community to continue operations locally. The result: approximately 100 new jobs compared to the possible loss of up to 1,500 jobs. The National Alliance of Business, under the direct leadership of two Oneida National Bank officers, seeks to obtain job opportunities for youth, the disadvantaged, veterans and ex-offenders.Regularly scheduled ""on the farm"" counseling by the six agricultural representatives and the four branch managers experienced in farm lending is an integral part of the aggressive agricultural call program. Approximately 3,400 such calls are made each year. Over 90% of the farms served are small family-owned and operated farms with an average farm investment of $125,000, which require both long-term operating funds -- financing which the Oneida National Bank has long been providing to the agricultural community. The bank's participation with the Farmers Home Administration helps provide financing otherwise unavailable to the marginal or capital-short farmer. Presently, approximately 25% of all agricultural loans are guaranteed by or participated with these agencies.Farmer-banker dinners, partially sponsored by Oneida National BAnk, are held each year in both Oneida and HErkemer counties with attendance exceeding 400 at each dinner. The recently instituted Women's Farm Finance Forum for wives of agricultural customers of the Oneida National Bank provides a series of programs designed to assist in creating a better understanding of the farm-bank credit and service relationship. Farm youth are encouraged, through the bank's calf-award program, to learn and develop an awareness of the farm-bank relationships.Both short-and long-term financing to counties, cities, towns, villages school districts fire districts and library systems is made available through the municipal department. Among the various municipalities within the delineated community may be found fire stations, health centers library buildings, parking garages, school buildings water and sewer systems, senior citizen housing and industrial parks all or partially financed with Oneida National Bank-provided funds. The interest and involvement in providing funds for short-term needs to the schools and governmental subdivisions within the community has made the Oneida National Bank one of the largest providers of such funds in upstate New York.We have set up a system of advisory boards throughout the region we service. Nine different advisory boards keep us up-to-date on the activities and needs of each of the areas which we serve. The boards are made up to key local leaders who are able to keep bank management informed as to how we can best serve customer needs.The history of Oneida National Bank is a history of people helping people, their community, their government and their businesses. Our commitment is to serve the needs and fulfill the dreams of our community through the application of all our bank's resources, both financial and human, to the benefit of our local community."
Community Banker Reserve Plan Receives Mixed Reaction,The American Banker,"February 9, 1979, Friday","There also is near universal agreement that it cannot pass Congress.As it evolved in a meeting here last week, the primary recommendation would drastically slash Fed reserve requirements to an average of around 4%, with vault cash included. Fed reserve requirements then would be extended to all banks and thrift institutions and cover all accounts, including time and passbook accounts at savings and loans, savings banks, and credit unions.So far, the plan is the suggestion only of the ABA's community banker division which includes the smaller banks. ABA leaders meet here next week to decide whether this also should be the ABA position.The courageous part of the community banker plan was willingess to see all banks subject to reserve requirements. This was a remarkable concession in view of past insistence by bank lobbies that the Federal Reserve System should be voluntary.Other lobbies here were stunned by the recommendation which they viewed as almost the same as endorsing mandatory Fed membership for all banks.However, ABA community bank leaders insist -- vehemently, passionately -- that they are suggesting no such thing.They said their plan to subject all banks to Fed reserves was different from the concept of obligatory Fed membership in three ways -- reserves would not have to be held at the Fed but could be deposited at correspondent banks; banks would not be subject to Fed supervisory authority, and the reserve rate would be drastically cut.This reasoning did not impress some lobbyists here.""How can you say it is not mandatory when you have no choice about putting up reserves?"" one said. ""Besides, if you have to post reserves, you might just as well join and get the other benefits.""Some bankers attending the ABA community bankers meeting last week suggested that the overriding interest at times appeared more toward removing what the bankers considered to be competitive inequities, rather than solving the Fed's membership problem.This was a factor in the suggestion that Fed reserve requirements be extended to time and savings deposits of savings and loan associations, savings banks, and credit unions.""Passions run deep on this subject of unfair competition,"" one banker said. ""This recommendation certainly reflected in part their concern at seeing again and again regulations and laws which extend bank-like powers to competitors -- but not bank-like regulations.""It is this part of the community banker proposal -- the suggestion that Fed reserve requirements be extended to all financial institution deposits -- that makes it almost politically unattainable.Thrift institutions and credit unions will oppose it forcefully. They also will be joined by those banks which are uneasy about giving up their right to remain free of Fed reserve requirements.Thrift lobbies are convinced they could field a coalition capable of blasting the bill before it moved an inch, but this gives them no joy. In fact, the latest ABA strategy is evoking angry phrases from the opposition.The reason is that thrift lobbies coul wind up being blamed for scuttling the grand plan to solve the Fed's membership problem which they regard as essentially a problem caused by the indifference and self-interest of their bank competitors."
Fed to Stress Community Dialogue In Reviewing Bank Expansion Bids,The American Banker,"December 24, 1979, Monday","In a new policy statement on the yearold law, the Board stressed that it would focus on continuing communication between lenders and community groups as a major factor in its decisions.Significantly, the statement also rejects the view held by some community groups that a gap between the level of deposits from a neighborhood and the amount of credit extended there is evidence of illegal discrimination.Several community groups have argued that when lenders fail to return as much in loans to neighborhoods as they take in deposits there, the regulators should judge their community lending record poor.The statement, approved in an open meeting, said that the Board believed that there were many reasons for disparities in the two figures, such as varying housing demand.Rather than focus on those figures, the statement said, ""the Board is more concerned with the lender sensitivity to the needs of each area.""In stressing aggressive communication with the community, the Board appeared to be reaching toward a balance between banks' past records of community lending and its recent or future efforts in that area.This accent on recent and future efforts appears in the portion of the statement referring to the Board's method of reviewing lending records.""The Board expects banks to offer types of credit listed on their CRA statements throughout their communities. In assessing banks' records the Board views favorably the record of a bank that has defined its community credit needs, that offers credit that appears to help meet community credit needs, and that seeks to meet needs for that credit in its entire community,"" the statement said.On the suggestion of Fed governor Philip E. Coldwell, the statement will be revised before it is publicly issued to emphasize that banks should ""spread their lending capacity evenly over all segments of the community,"" rather than allocate credit preferentially to neighborhoods in an effort to comply with the law.
Working with BanksIf anything, the statement reflects the Board's willingness to work with banks to develop solutions when problems arise.However, the statement said that the agency in its investigations has found ""some evidence of disparity in bank housing-related lending to low- and moderate-income neighborhoods compared with higher income areas.""This disparity did not appear to arise from housing demand or safety or soundness considerations, it added.""When faced with such evidence, the Board will inquire closely, both into the bank's efforts to ascertain credit needs and make the community aware of its credit services, and into any policies or practices of the bank that may discourage credit applications from or discriminate against parts of the bank's community,"" the statement said.In considering applications, the Board said it would continue to give weight to future commitments a bank may make.""When such commitments are offered by an applicant to outweigh adverse aspects in a CRA record, the Board will consider the likelihood of accomplishment and in future applications and examinations will review closely an applicant's performance on previous CRA commitments,"" the statement said.
Protest ProceduresIn addition to these outlines on how the Board will analyze a bank's record of community lending, the statement also contains procedures the agency will follow in considering applications that have been protested under the law.The statement said the agency expects community organizations to investigate and document their complaints, and to bring them to the attention of the banks involved, before protesting an application.The statement also warned the parties to a protest that any direct communication with Board members on a case must be in writing and that it would become part of the official record.The Board said it will continue its recent policy of encouraging meetings between protesters and lenders.But the statement added that the withdrawal of a protest does not alter the agency's obligation to review the applicant's CRA record on its own.Even if the parties agree, the Board need not approve the agreement, the statement said.The statement added that the Board does not endorse agreements to allocate credit and that it will ""closely scrutinize any such preferential program to ascertain that it is not inconsistent with the safety and soundness of the bank involved.""
FFIEC ReviewThe Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council reviewed the Fed statement last Thursday, but the other bank and thrift regulators failed to act on it.The statement will go back to the FFIEC for another review, the Fed said.The statement will be published in the Federal Register.The CRA requires Federal regulators to encourage financial institutions to meet the credit needs of the local communities in which they operate, within the bounds of the lenders' safety and soundness. The regulators must also assess the lenders' records of meeting those needs and take their records into account when evaluating applications for expansion."
"European Community Pursues Regional Approach to LDC Aid;
European Economic community",The American Banker,"December 14, 1979, Friday","The original dependencies, as they themselves achieved independence, moved from the implementing convention of the Treaty of Rome to two Yaounde conventions and into the first Lome convention. Their numbers had increased from 18 at the first Yaounde convention in 1963 to 46 at the first Lome convention in 1975, their population from 70 million to 270 million. They were no longer primarily French speaking black African ex-dependencies, but a mixture of French and English speaking countries, African countries (whether former dependencies or not), and Caribbean and Paficif countries. Lome was unique in that it provided a contractual package based on a Treaty obligation: it was negotiated between the EEC and a group of partner states from the less developed world amounting to half the total number of LDCs. It covered in a single package official aid, investments, trade advantages, compensatory finance for certain primary products and an institutional framework for the implementation of the convention. Lome II, which has just been signed by the EEC and 57 ACP states, has a similar structure but with an increased financial commitment and more comprehensive treatment for primary products.In its implementation, Lome has not lived up to all the expectations it created. The finance made available was limited in relation to the needs of the LDCs, yet in the first four years of the convention only 20% of the funds have actually been spent. A further 50% has been committed to specific projects but complicated administrative procedures have restricted the anticipated flow of funds to the LDCs. However, as a program it was perhaps the only truly imaginative approach to the North/South problem made in the 1970s, a decade singularly lacking in new initiatives in this area of international affairs.The European Community's relations with the Third World are not, however, confined to the ACP countries, although it is these that have the most sophisticated aid, trade and investment relationship with the EEC. A series of agreements has been concluded between the Community and the Mahgreb and Mashreq countries of North Africa and the Middle East. Thus Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Syria and Jordan all have cooperation agreements covering aid, investment and trade.The Asian countries are less well served although this might have been different had the Dutch East Indies, with 100 million people, not achieved independence from the Dutch in 1949, long before the Treaty of Rome was signed.A joint study group was set up with the members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in 1975. ASEAN is the fastest growing trading bloc in the Third World, but progress towards a cooperation agreement has been disappointingly slow. Political and commercial links are also being sought with the Middle East through the Euro-Arab dialogue. Commercial cooperation agreements have been concluded between the EEC and India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Other Asian and Commonwealth countries have been allowed important tariff concessions within the Generalized Scheme of Preferences on their exports to the Community since 1973.So the picture as a whole is one of a regional approach by the European Community to the LDCs with the Lome countries in the most advantageous position followed by certain Mediterranean countries of North Africa and the Middle East and then the Asian and Latin American groups with trade agreements. As an exception to this pattern, food aid from the Community is organized on a global rather than a regional basis.The EEC's positive attitude to the Third World is the result of varied historical, cultural, economic and commercial ties. Nearly 40% of the EEC exports go to the LDCs: if they were to finance the rising cost of energy by reducing their imports from the EEC, unemployment in the EEC would rise significantly.The fact that the Third World comprises a major commercial and financial market for the Community has implications for both government and business. The agreements that have been described are governmental, but the implications for banking, industry and commerce were profound. This is particularly the case with the ACP countries where the European Development Fund disposes of an agreed sum over a five-year period. The European Investment Bank also operates in the ACP, as well as in the Mahgreb and Mashreq countries. These funds from both the EDF and the EIB are available for projects in the relevant LDCs.The total fund available under Lome was $4,330 million. (Figures taken from a Commission information sheet, October, 1979. Dollar conversion is at the rate of one European unit of account $1.30 and rounded to the nearest $10 million). This was made up of $3,840 million from the EDP and $490 million in loans from the EIB.Stabex is the scheme of transfers for the stabilization of export earnings in relation to certain primary products, a special feature of the Lome conventions. Under Lome I, Stabex covered mainly soft products. Under Lome II, the number of products covered is increased from 34 to 44 and now includes rubber, wool and pulses. A new section of the convention establishes a similar system for manerals.The amount available from the EIB by way of loans has also been increased, to $1180 million.The EDF is managed by the European Commission in Brussels. Projects are selected from programs drawn up by and with each ACP state. Selectio of a project is done in cooperation between the EEC and the ACP. In each ACP country there is an EEC delegation whose job it is to assist in the identification and preparation of projects. Projects are then put out to tender and in general contracts are awarded to firms based in one of the EEC member states or in an ACP country.The European Investment Bank operates separately although in cooperation with the EDF. It identifies and prepares projects on its own. All finance is on a loan basis although the terms are frequently softened by special involvement from the EDF, usually in the form of interest rate subsidies.There are opportunities for private sector firms to obtain the contracts relating to these projects, by making contact with the Projects Directorate of Directorate General VIII at the European Commission, Brussels, for EDF projects and with the overseas department of the European Investment Bank, Luxembourg, for EIB projects. The contracts are actually awarded by the ACP themselves, therefore contact with the governments of ACP states is important for interested firms.Joint management and cooperation are key elements in the Lome conventions. A Cenre for Industrial Development was set up under Lome I to disseminate information and promote cooperation between the EEC member states and the ACP states. Lome II has set up a Technical Centre for Agriculture and Rural Cooperation operating on similar lines. There are also more detailed provisions in Lome II to further encourage co-financing of projects: a significant participation in co-financing operations by Arab funds and the World Bank has been noted recently.On a practical level, Lome I has not been successful as its authors would have wished. The flow of funds to the LDCs has been slow, due in part to administrative procedures and in part to the unsuitability of some of the proposed projects. The development of trade between the EEC and the ACP has inevitably been affected by the general recession in world trade, and the balance of trade has changed from a surplus in the ACP's favor to a surplus in favor of the EEC. However, latest figures for 1979 show a reversal of this trend. A five-year convention has the important advantage of security, but the disadvantage is that the real value of the agreed fund diminishes due to inflation.Although the ACP have some justified criticisms, the Lome conventions represent a significant step forward in relations between the industrialized EEC and the LDCs. There is ample scope for further progress, but the transition from foreign aid, in the sense of largesse distributed by rich nations to poor nations, to the concept of a cooperation contract between equal partners cannot be achieved overnight.One of the principal demands of the LDCs has been to be treated as equal partners. This presupposes not only an achievement of the standing of ACP countries, but also the dismantling of the special relationship between certain European countries and their former dependencies. Differences in relationships with third countries are disappearing and there has been a diversification of contacts, leading to a recognition that in this area all countries, ACP or EEC, have the same rights and obligations.As we move into the '80s it is clear that new relationships are being forced upon the world. The demands of the LDCs are underpinned more and more by their growing economic and industrial strength. A framework is now beginning to emerge which enables the developed countries to respond appropriately with aid, trade and cooperation. In this context the EEC has demonstrated a breadth of vision which has set new standards in relations between developed countries and the LDCs."
CofC Allows FNB Chicago to Form Community Development Subsidiary,The American Banker,"March 13, 1979, Tuesday","The subsidiary, to be called First Chicago Neighborhood Development Corp., will support the development of Chicago neighborhoods by participating in equity investments and loans in residential, commercial and industrial projects.This is the second time the Comptroller has authorized a national bank to establish a local community development corporation to promote the revitalization of urban neighborhoods. The first authorization was given to the North Carolina National Bank in April, 1978, to promote reinvestment in an inner-city neighborhood in Charlotte.First Chicago Neighborhood Development Corp. will be wholly owned by First National Bank and capitalized with an initial investment of $1 million. The bank expects to extend credit to the subsidiary once development is under way.James E. Smith, chief of planning, legislation and corporate responsibility for First Chicago Corp., said that investments by the subsidiary would be made through partnerships with not-for-profit and other corporations, using public program support where appropriate.First Chicago is required to include a majority of community-at-large representatives on the board of the community development subsidiary."
ABA Offers Planning Workshop and CEO Program to Community Bankers,The American Banker,"December 31, 1979, Monday","The technique for developing an orderly process to deal with change and controlling a bank's destiny will be taught in a new ABA education program entitled ""A Planning Workshop for Community Bank Senior Management"" who want to learn how to deal effectively with the future.Three basic principles of planning will be provided in this workshop: understanding the marketplace; developing objectives in response to the marketplace; and developing strategies to meet those objectives.Leadership for the two day program will be provided by a professional bank planner assisted by community bankers, experienced in developing a plan for their own banks, who will be available throughout the workshop for peer group and individual consulting basis.In order to make the planning workshop more meaningful, attendees will be asked to submit readily available bank background data which will be converted into market share and trend comparisons to be used for objective setting sessions.Two separate ABA Planning Workshop programs are being offered: Jan. 26-27, at the Royal Sonesta Hotel in New Orleans, and April 26-27, at the Hyatt Regency O'Hare in Chicago.To encourage team participation from senior management staff of any one bank, the fee schedule for ABA member banks is $295 for the first registrant and $240 for each additional registrant from the same bank. For non-ABA-member banks, registration fees are $350 and $300.Another education program offered by the ABA is designed to provide management concepts and techniques for chief executive officers of community banks. Management by objectives, organizational behavior, time management and management of pricing services are just a few of the managerial functions taught.Management roundtables led by experienced community banker discussion leaders will provide CEOs with opportunity to share experiences with peer groups. Topics include; management of human resources, financial management and shaping a bank's future.Two separate sessions of the ABA CEO Program will be held; March 30-April 4 at the Hilton Inn and Conference Center at Inverrary Ft. Lauderdale, Florida; and May 11-16 at the Houstonian Inn Conference Center, Houston, TExas.Tuition for the CEO Program is $595 for ABA members. Enrollment is limited to 100 for each session.For further information about either of the two education programs; the Planning Workshop or the Ceo Program, contact Lucille Parslow, American Bankers Association, Community Bankers Division, 1120 Connecticut Ave., N.W., Washington, D.C. 20036, or call (202) 467-4012."
Community Bank Survival Depends on Ability to Access the Capital Markets,The American Banker,"July 24, 1979, Tuesday","Up to now, this decline has not developed. Even though state after state has opened up to branching and holding companies, ranks of the independent banks have not been depleted.The high performance of the community bank is one reason why this has not happened. For if a community bank can earn 1% or more on assets while a larger competitor has trouble coming even close to that level, obviously there is no reason why the smaller institution should be absorbed.Still, many fear for the future of the community bank.They see its high performance coming from compact size and lower overhead, plus a greater supply of core deposits with their lower cost. They recognize that computers have become so readily available that size is no longer a criterion determining whether a bank can gain the maximum benefits of electronic data processing. But they worry about the community bank's ability to attract the talent it needs and to gain access to the money and capital markets for future lendable funds.The talent issue is not clear cut, however.It must be granted that smaller banks can not pay the salaries that large institutions can. Frequently the graduates of graduate business schools will go to work at their first job for a higher salary than the community bank pays its executive vice president or veteran lending officers.And nothing is likely to change in this regard.But the real question is whether this super bright talent is necessary to make a bank perform well.Banking is a people business. And in many instances the ability to understand customers and to empathize with them is far more important than a thorough understanding of the financial structure of their cash needs.Banker after banker reports that the character of the borrower is far more important than his financial statements and gives a better indication of whether the loan will be repaid. And loyalty built up over the years often means more in determining relationships than the rates paid on savings and charged on borrowings.This helps explain why new bank entrants into a community have so hard a job making inroads if the banks already there are doing their job. And the type of talent needed to excel in a community bank is far more likely to be developed by being raised in a small community and knowing the people than by going to graduate school.The second problem -- access to the money market, appears harder for the community banker to overcome. For it is likely that more and more of all banks funds will have to be purchased as the years pass.The public is waking up to the folly of keeping funds in savings deposits when inflation rates vastly exceed what banks are allowed to pay under Regulation Q. This is one reason why America now has one of the lowest rates of savings among the major Western nations.Corporations are also becoming less and less willing to leave compensating balances. For they find it far more profitable to pay fees for services and use their available funds in the money market or elsewhere.The bank requirement that the earnings credits on balances be reduced to cover the bank's reserve requirement costs also does not help encourage treasurers to leave money in the bank.Thus bankers find it more and more necessary to buy funds through certificates of deposit, commercial paper, money market certificate sales and other approaches that involving tapping the money and capital markets. And here the larger bank has a definite advantage because of its size and the far greater marketability of its money market paper in the secondary market if the holder needs his funds back.This is something community bankers will have to work on.Maybe the answer will involve cooperative sales of paper by several smaller banks to give their paper the stature of larger institutions' borrowings.Maybe it will involve an insurance fund with a major insurance company, such some smaller municipalities have initiated to enhance the stature of their borrowings.But somehow the community banker will have to improve his ability to access the money and capital markets. For, like it or not, this impersonal market will continue to grow as a major source of bank funds. And the bank that can not tap this impersonal rate and quality-sensitive pool of funds to meet its own needs will be the likely loser in the competition for viability, profitability and growth."
Community Bankers Fear Crisis Atmosphere Benefits Giant Banks,The American Banker,"October 30, 1979, Tuesday","This undoubtedly helps explain why bank stocks were among the worst hit when the investing public started to analyze what the new program means to various sectors.But if banks in general were hurt by the program, the smaller and medium sized banks fear that they are likely to be worse sufferers among the banking industry than the larger institutions. There are a number of reasons why they feel this way:First of all, as the Fed's dramatic announcement reached investors, they began to gravitate towards quality investments to a greater degree, widening spreads between top quality and second quality paper.This helps explain why spreads yield on between Aaa and Baa utilities jumped almost 100 basis points in the week following the Fed's announcement, while spreads between A1 and A2 commmercial paper rose by 50 basis points in the same period.To community bankers and thrift executives who solicit money market funds this is bad news, even though they well recognize that there is no direct correlation between size of institution and quality of the operation.In factr medium sized and community banks usually have higher capital to deposits ratios than larger institutions do.Yet the investment community usually rates paper of larger banks and thrifts as having higher quality than that of smaller ones. The result is that it will be far more difficult for smaller banks to sell paper on the money market in the period immediately ahead than in will be for larger banks. And both types will find it harder to compete against Treasury offerings of top quality ratings.Another problem that medium sized banks face is the fear that if trouble does develop, the larger banks will be protected from failing while they won't.This is based on the idea that while failure of a larger bank would be a great shock to the nation that the Government couldn't allow, failure of a moderate sized bank could be taken in stride in these days of adequate FDIC insuranceIt is the fear that the large will be protected and the smaller will not that makes so many bankers fear a program to help out Chrysler.When a bail out of Chrysler is mentioned, most are violently opposed. For they recognize that were Chrysler not the giant it is, no effort at Government protection or aid would have been proposed; and they feel the same preference would be given to big banks over smaller ones.Possibly this is why Comptroller of the Currency Heimann indicated in his remarks at the ABA convention in New Oreleans that he specifically fears big bank failures in the period immediately ahead. But remarks like these alone do not placate the medium sized bank.Many medium sized banks also find they can not raise their prime rates enough to match going rates in the money market, even as larger banks post new record levels on their loans. For bank rates in their communities are set by tradition, and a 14% prime or higher is just not possible, even though the same borrowers expect close to 14% on their money market certificates.The publicity that high interest rates is getting in the media helps gain acceptance of higher borrowing rates, but it is still hard to impose them in communities that have counted on stable, traditional bank lending charges for years.Finally more and more officers of community banks are talking about changes in the McFadden Act, with interstate competition coming to their doors. And they feel that here again, they will be the losers if this does develop - furthering a trend that started with the national spread of the loan production office.No wonder the first question that banking observers are asked when meeting community bankers is ""What are the giants in New York and Chicago up to?""?For many community bankers feel the giants have major advantages over small banks in today's environment, and they fear that these giants will use these advantages to erode the smaller banks' market share."
Taking the Initiative in Community Relations Can Help Banks' Image,The American Banker,"October 16, 1979, Tuesday","The rationale for this involvement is understandable. Financial institutions are tied to the communities they serve. The nature of our respective businesses compels us to involve ourselves in activities that benefit our service areas. It is simply good business.Although it is important that financial institutions continue their support of local causes, a question arises as to ultimate recognition the individual bank receives in its community. Bank's support of so many diverse efforts may tend to dilute awareness of the individual banks' involvement. In general fund-raising campaigns across a community, for example, the recognition opportunities for Bank A or Bank B are limited. The support of both banks is needed so the civic or charitable group can continue to benefit the community, but each bank can be submerged as just one of many in the campaign. (In a sense, a bank's involvement is almost a defensive action to avoid being conspicuous by its absence.)From a budgetary standpoint, banks wind up spreading themselves thin. They try to be ""all things to all men"" by making ""representative"" donations to many organizations. It is an impossible task: the organizations do not get what they need nor does the bank receive recognition for its efforts. The community relations officer is left to divide the bank's contributions allocation as best as he or she can. Often there is the added burden of not having a clear direction from management about the banks' objectives in its contributions and other community relations activities.How, then, is the financial institution to cope with this no-win situation? I think it is necessary to step back from our banks' various community relations activities in order to get a better perspective of what we have been doing and how our actions really fit into the objectives of our institution. Part of this involves taking an audit of the civic and charitable organizations in our service areas. More importantly, the bank must determine the kind of identity it wants to project in the area it serves.Two years ago, Eastern Savings Bank underwent this review process in the borough of the Bronx, where we have five or nine offices. The decline of the area is well known, but beneath the surface exists considerable community spirit. What we sought to identify was a segment of the population toward which we would make a special effort linking our bank with their needs and aspirations.The group we focused on was, and still is, the borough's older adults. This group has experienced disruption with the rapid changes in many Bronx neighborhoods. Many have become isolated due to fear, declining city services, limited incomes and the infirmities of age. We determined that by focusing our energies and resources on the older adults we could perform a valuable service, while establishing our own distinct district identity from the competition.Eastern Savings Bank is not a social service organization. In order to achieve our objectives we required the cooperation of organizations which were experienced in working with older adults. Following a six-month audit of agencies in the borough, we approached the Bronx Community College Center for Aging with the suggestion that the center and Eastern develop a joint project combining educational, recreational and other elements under which the local senior citizens could be brought together. From this initiative came a series of co-sponsored events. The largest and most important activity out of this cooperation has been the Bronx Senior Citizen Olympics, which attracted more than 700 older adults last year and twice that number this year.The Olympics program has included sporting competition and demonstrations, health and nutrition information, physical examinations and other features. Hundreds came from their homes and senior citizen centers within the borough for a day of enjoyment and fellowship with other human beings --thus breaking the pattern of isolation many had entered. At the same time, Eastern Savings Bank was able to establish a ""one to one"" relationship with older adults in the Bronx.I firmly believe that financial institutions should continue supporting the many civic and charitable organizations and causes we have traditionally aided. In our community relations efforts, however, we should approach worthwhile groups to intitiate efforts that benefit the community while showing the banks' leadership and commitment.Reaching out to the communities we serve requires an investment of resources -- certainly, a financial commitment is necessary. But add up how much your bank is spending already just to be ""represented."" Personnel must be employed to research the service area, contact representative groups, and follow through with programs -- which is exactly how a bank performs its other business functions.The bank's facilities and equipment may be required on occasion, as well."
"Boston Mutual Gives Former Quarters, A Landmark, to Community Service Unit",The American Banker,"March 12, 1979, Monday","The bank realized it was underutilizing the 102-year-old facility, briefly considered razing it and then, because of the building's landmark status, decided to sell it to the community group for the token amount of one dollar.In exchange, the CEDC promised to renovate the five-story Victorian gothic structure for which Charlestown Savings provided a $275,000 loan at 8 1/2%.The bank recently increased the original loan amount to $350,000, to enable CEDC to complete its restoration project. This second stage of funding was loaned at 9%, still below current market rates, John Stewart, Charlestown is senior vice president of operations, said in an interview.CEDC, which has not requested any Federal financing, will also pay real estate taxes to the city despite its non-profit status.""We felt it was imperative that the building be kept as a community service facility, and it was equally important that the project be as financially sound as possible,"" Gus Charbonnier, president of CEDC, stated. ""Our combination of commercial and public service tenants, along with the help we received from Charlestown Savings, enable us to provide valuable service to the community on a virtually self-sufficient basis.""The building houses a combination of public service agencies and commercial tenants which will make it a focal point of community activity, the bank said in a prepared statement.This project, the statement continued, provides an example of how private industry and local citizens' groups can work together, without public funds, to turn old buildings of historic and estethic significance into economically viable resources."
Community-Minded Savings Bank Thrives on Competition,The American Banker,"May 14, 1979, Monday","Located in the long Island North Shore Village of Roslyn, some 20 miles from Manhattan, it was the first financial institution in what is now Nassau County, and for some time its only savings bank. As a result, Roslyn was for many years in a pleasantly uncompetitive position, showing a constant slow but steady growth in deposits and assets.The Omnibus banking bill of 1960 changed that picture. While it permited Roslyn Savings Bank to establish additional branches, it also opened the door to banks from other areas. Competition, however, proved not a drawback but a stimulus to expansion and growth. In 1960, Roslyn's assets were $78 million. Today they are over $600 million.Nowadays, almost all savings institutions pride themselves on being ""community minded."" Rosyln seems to be especially effective in maintaining the personalized service and sense of community involvement that has always characterized the bank. Personalized service may well be one of the reasons that Roslyn has been able to stand up to the competition of the metropolitan banks. Another may be its demonstrated ability to keep up with new banking developments.Still, the people who hurry by car, bus or taxi to one of the five Roslyn offices find a good deal of the friendly, old fashioned feelings and attitudes that endeared the institution to generations of earlier depositors.Roslyn is credited with several innovations. In 1970, when banks went from quarterly to daily compounding, Roslyn introduced the concept of ""Continuous Compounding."" Though the term was later deemed to be confusing by authorities and was discontinued, it dramatized for many how their money could grow at Roslyn.In 1973, during the days of the ""wild cards,"" Roslyn Savings Bank was the first financil institution to offer an 8% certificate. Recently, it has made a special effort to make sure that its depositors know that there is no interest penalty to heirs upon the death of certificate holders.Along with two other institutions, Roslyn pioneered the WOW account (written order of withdrawal, Roslyn's version of the NOW account) in New York State and today offers free checking to depositors. Non-checking account customers can avail themselves of Roslyn's five cent money orders -- just about the only nickel bargin left!Roslyn's tradition of friendly service plays a big part. We are well aware that servie is often a more important reason than rates when people select a bank. All of our employees are constantly urged to keep this in mind.One way the employees are encouraged to give friendly and helpful service is through the bank's monthly employee publication, ""The Relater."" Readers are kept up to date on banking developments and given useful tips on pleasing customers.Roslyn customers receive some more tangible services, too. Each office has drive-in stations and walk-up windows. These are open long after regular banking hours from 8:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. weekdays, 8:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Saturdays -- giving Roslyn depositors more basic banking hours than offered by many other banks in the area.Roslyn's free-standing red brick Georgian Colonial style buildings are designed to harmonize with the suburban environment in which they are located. Not only do the nicely landscaped buildings achieve that end, they also convey an air of permanence and stability that the bank management feels may be lacking in store-front shopping center locations.President Floyd York says, ""Banks are for banking; shopping centers are for shopping."" The free-standing locations also enable Roslyn to provide the popular private off-street parking for its customers as opposed to the fender-denting shopping center parking lots of some of its competitors.The Roslyn Savings Bank's very name implies community involvement, and indeed it has been a center of activity and a source of community support throughout its history. In World War II, Roslyn women rolled bandages in the bank's offices; during the Bicentennial, Nassau County's travelling exhibit played host to thousands of visitors at each Roslyn office. Historic murals, depicting the life of the community, are mounted in the Roslyn, Bellmore and Farmingdale offices, and one is being prepared for the West Hempstead office. The bank has underwritten the printing of community publications, made its premises available for health care and senior citizens' activities. Woodbury, its newest office, features a heavily-used community room.In short, if one were to play the postioning game popular in advertising circles, one might say that The Roslyn Savings Bank is a ""home-town bank utilizing the modern techniques.""One of those techniques is a sophisticated marketing approach. Roslyn's marketing department has surveyed the reading and listening habits of its depositors and potential depositors, compiled computer data to establish the demographics of its service areas, and used the data as a basis for both broad and specific advertising and promotion campaigns. Original art prints, commissioned by the bank, of historic Long Island landmarks have been used as traffic building gifts for customers and visitors for a number of years.Care and selectivity have also gone into Roslyn's choice of media. The bank was one of the early sponsors of the Bernard Meltzer, ""What's Your Problem?"" radio program. This program's enthusiastic audience has caused it to become a New York City phenomenon, with listeners closely following Mr. Meltzer's advice on family and financial matters.Another fortunate selection is the Media Networks plan, which enables Roslyn to place advertising inserts in regional editions of five national magazines --Time, Sports Illustrated, New York, Newsweek and U.S. News and World Report.The success of Roslyn's marketing program can be measured by an unusually high growth in deposits. Roslyn's agency, Herbert Haines Advertising, is especially proud that the bank's marketing and promotional efforts have been recognized by its peers. For the past several years, numerous citations have been received from local ad clubs as well as metropolitan and New York State marketing associations.But perhaps the ""award"" most in keeping with The Roslyn Savings Bank's image comes when a grandmother open as account for a new grandchild, saying ""My grandmother started an account for me at Roslyn when I was born. I want to do the same for my grandchildren!"""
"Ohio, Mass. Mergers Approved on community lending commitments;
$3 Mil. Earmarked",The American Banker,"June 6, 1979, Wednesday","The merger application of the $40.8 million-deposit Waverly Cooperative Bank, Belmont, and the $35.8 million-deposit Reliance Cooperative Bank, Cambridge, was approved by commissioner Gerald T. Mulligan, despite ""regulatory concern"" over ""Reliance's performance in meeting the mortgage needs of the Cambridge community.""In a telephone interview, Mr. Mulligan said Reliance's lending record in Cambridge was ""totally inappropriate to a bank its size.""In addition to ""very positive Community Reinvestment Act statements"" submitted for the merged bank, the applicants also promised, according to the decision, ""to use their best efforts to place a total of $3 million in mortgage and personal loans in the Cambridge area over the next two years."" This rate of investment in Cambridge will be almost 10 times Reliance's investment rate there over the past three years, the decision said.In addition to the concern over service to the community, the commissioner expressed concern over the declining net worth to deposit ratio of Waverly Cooperative Bank. The commissioner observed that Waverly's deposits have nearly tripled since 1971, which has resulted in a net worth to deposit ratio significantly below the cooperative bank industry average. This thin surplus ratio has impared Waverly's ability to expand its operations or continue its deposit growth.Reliance, on the other hand, has had a stable deposit position and developed a surplus to deposit ratio in excess of the industry average. The merger, ""will produce a larger, healthier institution with a branch structure more appropriate for vigorous competition within Middlesex County. Waverly's present surplus shortage will be relieved by Reliance's surplus strength,"" the commissioner said in the decision.The merger of the banks also will extend to customers of Reliance additional services now offered by Waverly including student ""HELP"" loans, individual retirement accounts, Keough plan accounts, mortgage insurance and automobile loans, the decision said. Operational savings would also result, which would be reflected in the new bank's pricing policies, the decision said.The new institution, to be called Reliance, will do a marketing study to determine the credit needs of the Cambridge community and will begin an advertising campaign to promote its deposit and loan services, the decision said. In addition, the bank promised to contact local real estate brokers to establish relationships with them and tell them of Reliance's commitment to lend in the area.""This application graphically demonstrates the very positive consumer and banking ramifications of applying the standards of the Community Reinvestment Act to the state's financial institutions,"" the commissioner commented in the decision."
"UCB Joins County, Hispanic Community Group in Home Rehab Loan Program",The American Banker,"December 7, 1979, Friday","The program is structured so that UCB will not lose money on the loans, despite the low interest rates at which they will be made.As announced by the bank, the county and the United Neighborhood Organization of East Los Angeles, the county over a period of time will deposit up to $1.2 million, which the bank will place in a noninterest-bearing reserve account. The deposit in part will compensate for the lower rates on the loans.The bank will lend up to $6 million to the county, which will process and make the loans to the individual families. Since the bank is actually making the loans not to the individual homeowners but to the county, interest earned on the loans will be tax-free, providing further compensation for low loan interest rates.A spokeswoman for UCB said that in practice, the county will make the loans and place 20% of each loan amount into the bank reserve account, at which point the bank will make the loan to the county.The $1.2 million which the county will eventually deposit with the bank are Federal community development block grant funds, she said.
Disbursement of FundsAbout two-thirds of the funds will go for home rehabilitation in East Los Angeles, a heavily Hispanic populated area of the city. The remainder will be spread around other, unincorporated areas of Los Angeles County.The Los Angeles Department of Community Development will process all loan applications and supervise the contracting work on the homes. Terms for the loans will be up to 15 years. Los Angeles Supervisor Ed Edelman, whose district incorporates East Los Angeles, said community organizations such as the United Neighborhood Organization would seek qualified loan applicants and assist them in necessary paperwork, with the bank reviewing the creditworthiness of each applicant.The bank and the county said they anticipate being able to begin processing loans by Jan. 1.A bank spokeswoman said the contract signed with the county calls for a review annually. Whether the program will be renewed after the initial $1.2 million has been deposited with the bank depends on the general success of the program, she said.A spokesman for the United Neighborhood Organization of East Los Angeles said that more than 100 meetings were held in the area to determine the best kind of program to put together. Another source said UCB was approached to participate after another large bank had turned down the project, but did not name the other bank.Announcement of the plan has brought UCB widespread and favorable local publicity. Coverage was obtained in both Los Angeles daily newspapers, on four television stations, and two radio stations.UCB was also rewarded with a favorable editorial in Los Angeles. After briefly describing the program, the Times concluded the bank ""is trying to show the financial community that creating goodwill is good business in the long run as well as much-needed service to the whole community in the short run."""
CRA Has Benefited Banks and Their Communities,The American Banker,"October 15, 1979, Monday","The legislative history surrounding CRA reveals an apparent divergence between the premises upon which the House and the Senate based the need for CRA. The Senate's reasoning was most disconcerting. The Senate Banking Committee Report charged that the lack of regulators of ""systematic, affirmative programs to encourage lenders to give priority to the credit needs of their home areas"" has resulted in ""redlining in which local lenders export savings despite sound local lending opportunities.""The House, on the other hand, rather than finding redlining and exportation of savings from the local areas surrounding banks to be identifiable problems in need of solution, saw the act as a positive step toward encouraging ""more coordinated efforts between private investment and Federal grants and insurance in order to increase the viability of our urban communities.""In either case, the aim of the act is to increase the investment by banks in their communities, for Congress recognized that the effectiveness of community development programs depends in large part on private capital. Consistent with safe and sound lending, this is, of course, an admirable goal. In retrospect, what was particularly distressing to bankers was not so much the aim of CRA, but the wholesale indictment of the banks and the regulators, charging redlining by the banks and an undue emphasis by the regulators on deposit services in evaluating banking applications.At the time CRA was passed, both the House and Senate arguments were based upon data from only few of our nation's urban areas. We now have experienced one year with the act and have gained some insight which questions those distressing findings in the Senate report and which would suggest the House's reasoning to be more supportable and realistic.The Senate report defined redlining as the exportation of deposit funds from areas surrounding a bank's branches to other more remote areas, while an unmet demand for credit remains in the local area. In making a finding that redlining, as defined above, exists, the Senate implicity assumes that there are large urban deposits, that there is new money deposit growth in urban areas, and that there is an unmet demand for credit in these areas. Our experience does not support such assumptions.Statewide branching is a relatively recent occurance in New Jersey. Hence, most banks' main offices are in older urban areas. Banks normally monitor and report the growth of deposits by ""branch of liability."" The branch of liability is not necessarily the one closest to a depositor's home, but is merely the branch in which the account was originally opened. Depositors who opened accounts in urban offices years ago and who have moved to the suburbs, are still viewed by the banks as urban depositors. Likewise, depositors who live in the suburbs but who work and bank in an urban area are also viewed as urban depositors. Given large scale demographic shifts in the past two decades, this branch of liability reporting system generally overstates the amount of urban deposits. We found, for example, that deposits in one urban area which we serve were 200% higher using the branch of liability system than when we identified deposits by depositor address. In a recent hearing, one New York City savings bank demonstrated that 46% of all accounts chargeable to its head office belong to depositors who have addresses not just outside the city, but outside New York State.Urban deposit figures are often over-stated; then, as a result of historical recordkeeping and reporting methods. In addition to that, a study we did shows that, at least in New Jersey, mutual savings banks have been experiencing net deposit outflows in their urban based branches. So the ""redlining"" picture which the Senate painted -- significant urban deposits, steady deposit inflows to urban area branches, and exportation of those funds to suburban areas -- was dramatically overstated.The second assumption underlying the Senate's redlining charge is that there exists an unmet demand for credit in urban areas. Most of the studies relied upon by the Senate Committee focused on only the number of mortgages granted in a particular area. Recently, the Journal of Bank research reported on a study done by George J. Benston and Dan Horsky examining redlining and the demand for mortgages in the central city and suburbs. The authors note that previous redlining studies have pointed to the existence of redlining by merely comparing the number of mortgages made to inner city and suburban home buyers. In their study, Benston and Horsky attempted to identify and measure the demand for mortgages and to use this demand as the significant factor in determining if redlining exists in a given area.Recently, using the analysis of Benston and Horsky, we prepared a study which looked behind the number of mortgages granted in local urban areas to the factors influencing and creating the demand for mortgages in those areas. The results of this study would seem to diminish substantially the notion that redlining as defined by the Senate is a common practice, at least in our area.Many factors, including the economy and demographics, influence the demand for mortgages. In New Jersey, for instance, the population in six of the seven largest urban cities has declined steadily over the last 18 years. Obviously, as the population of an area decreases, the demand for housing also decreases. We found, for instance, that in one large city which we serve, one home in 28 was sold during 1978, while in a large suburban town which we also serve, one home in 18 was sold during the same period. The residential one-four family house stock declined during 1978 in the large city, while it rose in the suburban town. It is axiomatic that an area with a higher turnover rate and a housing stock that is increasing will produce a greater demand for mortgages.Census data for New Jersey provides a further source of explanation for the lower demand for mortgages in New Jersey's larger urban areas. The median family income in one large urban city which we serve, according to the 1970 census, was 35% lower than the median family income throughout the same SMSA. Unemployment was 77% higher. This lack of real income is a serious factor in assessing demand. It was noted that in the same urban area, ample opportunity to rent existed as the multi-family housing stock in that area was well above the multi-family housing stock in the entire SMSA.Determining whether there exists an unmet demand for mortgages is difficult, but the results of the Howard's studies would explain the lesser demand in at least one urban area for mortgages and would most likely produce similar findings in other urban areas.Based upon these findings, it would appear that the fact that fewer mortgages have been made in urban areas in recent years is a situation explained by other factors, and does not necessarily indicate that banks are redlining.In retrospect, the arguments set forth by the House in support of CRA -- that private financial commitment is an essential part of governmental community development programs -- were accurate and realistic. Activity in our area has borne this out.As recently as August, 1979, Stuart E. Eizenstat, Domestic Affairs Advisor to the President, toured Newark to observe its Neighborhood Improvement Program. This program helps local urban communities renovate their homes with the help of Federal and private money. Homeowner counseling is provided and cash rebates are made by the Neighborhood Improvement Program to low, moderate and middle income homeowners based on the value of their home renovations. While the program's operating costs are government funded, the homeowners obtain improvement financing from private sources. The program then provides a vehicle through which banks may make sound loans to local residents who wish to renovate their community. After reviewing the program, Mr. Eizenstat termed it ""the best housing program I have seen in the country."" This program typifies the type of program which the House was concerned with developing. If CRA provides banks with an added impetus to participate in such programs, then its purpose will have been well served.It seems clear to me that government grant programs alone cannot do the job completely, but that there must be community commitment coupled with private financing. This combination of government, community and private financing appears to be a coalition which can address and begin to solve a number of the problems in our urban areas.Initially, bankers were fearful of the effects CRA would have. The spector of credit allocation and bureaucratic interference with the internal affairs of banks loomed in most of our minds. There will no doubt be some abuses of CRA -- including abuses by some community groups and some banks who will use it as a weapon to delay branching aspirations of competitors. Generally, though, I believe the FDIC and its examiners can use CRA as Congress intended, and carefully avoid any actions or suggestions which hint of credit allocation.CRA has had a number of beneficial effects on our bank. The act's broad assessment factors span almost every department in the bank, from marketing to mortgage procurement. The preparation and review of the bank's CRA statement necessitated the cooperation of the various departments in the gathering and compilation of data. In the process, each department acquired a better understanding of the bank's overall role and commitment in the housing sector.Additionally, the CRA assessment factors provide management with a yardstick against which it can measure its community investment performance and the performance of those affected bank departments. The continual monitoring of CRA data, such as deposit source figures and the location of mortgage demand, also has given us more information about our communities. This information will be used by the bank in making other related decisions such as branching plans and marketing strategies.The CRA requirement that management constantly review with the board the bank's lending policy has provided us with an avenue to discuss with our trustees not only the current lending policy, but also the economic, political, legal and community developments which led to the formation of the policy.As a result, all of us -- officers and trustees -- are sensitized to the need to assist our local communities through sound lending. Consequently, we find ourselves more receptive to programs such as the Neighborhood Improvement Program, New Jersey mortgage finance agency programs, and other local neighborhood projects. It is our feeling that such participation can only benefit our local area.In looking back on the first year with CRA, we believe the act has demonstrated that it can have some beneficial effects on both banks and their communities. Management has been given a vehicle which has fostered communication both within and without the bank. First, we have examined ourselves and generally found that those indicating comments made in the Senate report were not warranted. Beyond that, CRA has increased our sensitivity to the needs of our urban communities. We are now in a better position to monitor our own performance -- and the communities we serve can only benefit from that."
"Urban Bankers, NBA Honored for Community and Educational Roles",The American Banker,"November 5, 1979, Monday","More than 200 dignitaries from the banking, finance and legislative communities attended the reception held on Capital Hill in the Committee on Banking, Finance, Urban Affairs' Wright Patman Room, to the Rayburn Office Building.A. Bruce Crawley, president of NAUB and vice president of public relations at First Pennsylvania Bank NA, Philadelphia, in brief address to the attendee, highlighted the difference between the NBA and NAUB by saying, ""The NBA is primarily composed of minority banking entrepreneurs . . . owners and managers of their own business. The NAUB, on the other hand, is not an organization of entrepreneurs, but one of mostly minority banking professionals working in majority banks, concerned with our own professional banking career development, encouraging minority high school and college youth to seek banking as a career, plus a keen interest in recycling our skills to help our black and brown brothers who find themselves in increasingly dire financial straits throughout this country.""Mr. Crawley addressed the issue of why the need for the NBA and NAUB by telling those present that ""In an industry dominated by such giants as Citicorp, Bank of America, and the First Bank of Chicago, the minority banks are indeed small businesses. They suffer from the same problems that small businessmen everywhere suffer from . . . lack of capitalization, lack of customers, lack of volume related efficiencies, and exclusion from the mainstream of industry expertise and revenues. Fanned by the cold winds of racial discrimination and segregation of 52 years ago, the formation of the NBA was necessary to alleviate the problems I just mentioned.""He further added that ""It's rather said, here we are 52 years after the founding date of the NBA, and all the reasons that caused them to spring into existence are still very much in evidence."" In talking of the need for the NAUB Mr. Crawley said "" . . . as first generation Black bankers, we're conscious of the fact that those who make it to the top in any industry have to have help. We, unfortunately, can't look to our parents, grandparents, austs, uncles or third cousins for guidance. None of them ever had a clerical job in the majority banks, and a management position was clearly of the question.""Mr. Crawley went on to say that ""In a society that is still basically biracial, sometimes we regretably can't even look to our white piers and supervisors on the job for the career growth direction we need and so desparately want. We understand that the only way we can realistically aspire to the real policy position in our banks is to be good at what we do . . . we hope one day to have Tom Wilcox's job at Crocker Bank or Walter Wriston job at Citicorp and other important policy positions in the banking community. These positions will allow us to even more effectively service our community as bankers and responsible citizens."""
ABA Community Bankers Favor Interest-Paying Reserves at Fed for All Depository Institutions,The American Banker,"January 31, 1979, Wednesday","During a two-day meeting here 137 bankers from small institutions discussed alternatives for solving the erosion of membership in the Federal Reserve System and rejected approaches contained in pending Congressional legislation in favor of universal reserves with no exemption for smaller banks. The position may come as a surprise to legislators who have proposed exemption of banks of $40 million and $50 million in deposit size from reserve requirements so that smaller institutions would not have to hold funds at the central bank.However, bankers at the meeting said the exemptions might be a ""bait or trap"" to get support for the legislation and might later be changed. In addition, they are advocating still lower reserve requirements than those proposed in the Congressional bills.The community bankers' position will be reported to the ABA leadership when it meets here in mid-February to develop a consensus on the trade group's position on the membership issue. The community bankers division is the largest single group in the banking leadership conference. Decisions on policy are taken on a one-bank, one-vote basis among those at the leadership meetings. The ABA is scheduled to testify before Congress on the problem at the end of next month.Robert W. Renner, chairman of the ABA's community bankers division and president of the $33.7 million-deposit Citizens State Bank, Hartford City, Ind. told reporters Tuesday that ""we believe that to keep a strong central bank it is necessary to keep universal requirements on a level that applies to all financial institutions, including mutual savings banks, savings and loans and credit unions. Reserves should be maintained at a level for monetary policy to be carried out but not at a higher level.""The community bankers' position is in conflict with ABA testimony before Congress last August. At a hearing both the ABA and the Independent Bankers Association of America warned that universal reserve requirements for all depository institutions would threaten the dual banking system.""Should universal reserves be enacted, the ultimate value of many state bank charters would be substantially diminished and many banks would over time opt to join the Fed as a national bank,"" John H. Perkins, then president-elect of the ABA and now president, told the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee. Mr. Perkins is also president of the $18.3 billion-deposit Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Co. of Chicago.An ABA spokesman said Tuesday that when the ABA made its position known last year, it was addressing proposals that had many unanswered questions in them.Mr. Renner acknowledged Tuesday that it will take much study to assess the effect of universal reserves on state banks. He said a major concern expressed at the meeting here was the effect on the state banking system. ""I am not about to suggest that the ABA leadership conference will accept or reject all of the community banker position,"" he added.He did criticize the central bank for being insensitive to members because ""they haven't done everything they could to make membership attractive.""He said a large majority of the 137 bankers attending the meeting had endorsed the new position. They represented national and state banks from 46 states. Of these, 51 banks have deposits under $25 million, 56 banks were between $25 million and $50 million and 30 over $50 million.One reporter asked whether there was likely to be a split among ABA members on the issue of how best to solve the Fed membership issue. Community banker William H. Kennedy Jr. replied,"" It's too early to tell. There is always that possibility when you look for a solution among 15,000 bankers. You have to look at what's best in the long-range picture."" Mr. Kennedy is chairman of the ABA's government relations council as well as of the $115.4 million-deposit National Bank of Commerce, Pine Bluff, Ark.Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Renner and L.J. Hebert Jr. told the press briefing that the decision came down to its being equitable for all financial institutions to keep reserves on all types of accounts, including savings, but they acknowledged that new requirements would have to be phased in for everybody.Asked whether their position was ""legislatively achievable,"" Mr. Hebert said was too early to tell because of the many variables in pending bills before Congress. Mr. Hebert is chairman of the government relations committee of the community bankers division and president of the $58.4 million-deposit Lafourche National Bank of Thibodaus, La.""As a political matter, why are you asking for reserves for credit unions?"" a reporter asked. The reporter commented there can be reason for applying reserves to savings and loan associationas but suggested CUs are just gnats in the financial industry.Mr. Kennedy replied: ""They are not gnats any more and are likely to become a whole lot bigger.""At the mid-February meeting the ABA leadership will consider the views of about 400 bankers, including the community bankers, in order to develop a formal position. At that time results of an ABA-commissioned study of the effect on the industry of unbundling of Fed services is also to be disclosed."
Calif. Update on Bank Community Activities Shows Wide Diversity,The American Banker,"July 16, 1979, Monday","The California BA's 32-page ""Community Performance Update,"" in which 57 small and large banks participated, summarizes in nearly 370 entries a wide diversity of means through which banks have responded to the needs of their communities.The report is the third such inventory published by the California BA since 1973, when ""a group of concerned bankers . . . discovered, much to their dismay, that the public had no idea of the breadth and depth of the bank's involvement,"" according to CBA immediate past president Thomas A. Deane, executive vice president of the $76.7 million-deposit Bank of America NT&SA, San Francisco, in a preface.Copies of the report are being distributed to news media, libraries, legislators, regulators and others in hopes that ""it will tell the true story of bankers and banks as responsible, participating citizens in the activities of their communities,"" according to John D. Horrall, its editor.Many of the entries in the report were common to most of the banks taking part in the survey. Most of the smaller banks, for instance, sponsored and supported local clubs and organizations pursuing community causes, and both large and small noted their donations to charity.A number of banks also noted their interest in business education through such approaches as, in the case of Redwood Bank, San Francisco, providing speakers for business classes at local high schools, or in the case of Security National Bank, Walnut Creek, offering tours of the bank's operations center and workshops for local high school students.Many of the other activities listed, however, covered a wide range of endeavor.Bank of Marin, San Rafael, has a volunteer program which provides horses and lessons free of charge to children with such handicaps as cerebral palsy, birth defects and mental retardation.Mexican American National Bank, San Diego, is an active participant in a used clothing drive for retarded children and is sponsor of youth boxing program.Imperial Bank, Los Angeles, joined together with a library and a cookie maker last year to finance a program for some 1,-100 minority children who were to receive awards for reading and submitting reports on four books in a two-week period. It has also sponsored a program to buy textbooks for students who cannot afford them at Los Angeles Southwest College, which has about 97% minority enrollment. The two programs cost the bank a total of $3,000.Bank of Canton of California has set up a volunteer program to teach English to non-English-speaking immigrants in the San Francisco Chinatown community.Valley National Bank, Glendale, supplies handbooks to help students overcome pre-graduation anxieties and make sound career educational and personal decisions.Security Pacific National Bank, Los Angeles, during the past year has put on 40 games of ""Marketplace"" which simulates how the marketplace works, throughout California.El Camino Bank, Anaheim, provides Christmas gifts for underprivileged and needy children in cooperation with public and civic organizations.Tri Counties Bank, Chico, awards $500 college scholarships for students from ""middle income"" families.The Bank of A, Levy, Oxnard, has created a junior board of directors composed of high school and college students.Wells Fargo Bank, San Francisco, has reduced energy consumption by more than 30% through such tactics as no longer using illuminated billboards, reducing its own outdoor lighting, and strictly controlling air conditioning and heating temperatures in its branches and offices.Wells Fargo has also been cutting back on its automobile fleet and reducing the size of the cars. With only 8% of its fleet consisting of compact and sub-compact cars in 1974, 38% are now the smaller cars.Security Pacific during 1977 reduced its heating gas consumption by 44.5% in 85 of its offices served by the Southern California Gas Co. -- and saved itself $141,713 in heating costs during two years.Lloyds Bank California is installing mercury vapor lighting systems in all its new offices to conserve energy.At least two banks -- County Bank of Santa Cruz, and First National Bank of Daly City, -- are holding seminars or classes to teach senior citizens the facts of crime prevention.Two other institutions -- North County Bank, Redding, and Citizens National Bank, Hanford -- have spearheaded drives to bring badly needed doctors into their communities.The Bank of Newport, Newport Beach, has developed and organized six ocean cruises for kidney dialysis patients by arranging to have dialysis machines and technical personnel aboard the cruise ships.Bank of Sonoma County, Santa Rosa, offers cardiopulmonary resuscitation and first aid training to its employees, while First Los Angeles Bank maintains special oxygen units in its facilities and trains its staff in the use of oxygen if needed by customers or employees."
Strong Community Role a Hallmark of Lee Gunderson,The American Banker,"October 7, 1979, Sunday","The 49-year-old Mr. Gunderson, who hails from this picturesque Wisconsin community and who has long been one of the state's most well-liked and well-respected banking leaders, said in a recent interview he is ready for the challenge and looks forward to ""giving service to an industry that has treated me fairly.""Fair-play and absolute interity -- two characteristics described most frequently by close friends -- have marked Mr. Gunderson's 27-year career in banking, which began in small South Dakota banks.Mr. Gunderson, who worked his way up in the banking business, acquiring control of his bank less than three years ago, currently serves as president of the $16.4 million-deposit Bank of Osceola.He joined the bank in 1966 as executive vice president and chief executive officer and was made president in 1976, the same year he completed a one-year term as president of the Wisconsin Bankers Association.Osceola, located 40 miles northwest of Minnesota's Twin Cities, is a stateline community of 1,100 on the St. Croix River. A large percentage of Osceola residents commute to Minneapolis-St. Paul jobs. ""Although I can hardly say we are a suburb but I'd say I think we have the best of both worlds,"" Mr. Gunderson citing the benefits of a rural environment close to big-city life.Mr. Gunderson's dedication to his community is evident in the growing number of new businesses and factories here which he either helped to attract or convince to expand. Expansion has been the result of innovative investment techniques involving Small Business Administration loans.Mr. Gunderson is a strong believer in small banks ""using all of the tools they can get their hands on for community development,"" which in his case included guaranteed SBA 502 loans used to finance an industrial park area near Osceola.Mr. Gunderson said he convinced himself that despite the SBA's sometimes-deserved reputation of creating mountains of unnecessary paperwork, the Federal agency can provide needed financial assistance to small towns like Osceola and he said he undertook numerous trips to SBA's Wisconsin headquarters in Madison to meet with officials.""Lee has always been a guy who does his homework, a guy who is truly committed to the best ideals of community banking,"" one of Mr. Gunderson's close associates, Bryan K. Koontz, executive vice president of the Wisconsin BA, says.Apart from community service, the Osceola banker has for a long time been deeply involved in trying to improve the industry's dialogue with the diverse and powerful consumer and public interest organizations in this state.""In my view, it is better for banking to try to sit down with these groups and try to build a working relationship with them in the hope that mutual differences can be worked out, particularly before burdensome regulations are imposed which help neither consumers nor bankers,"" Mr. Gunderson maintained.Particularly burdensome, he says, is Truth-in-Lending, which ""started out as a simple law and soon became a 10,000 page document.""In Wisconsin -- and now on a national level -- Mr. Gunderson said he wants to solidify banking's gains with consumer lobbies, ""trying to work out workable, realistic solutions to real consumer problems.""Besides the consumer area, Mr. Gunderson has also worked on national communications and advertising matters. He was a member of the ABA communications council from 1972-77, including a term as chairman.While council chairman, Mr Gunderson helped guide ABA policies in the creation of the new television commercials which reemphasized the ""full-service"" theme popular prior to the merger of the ABA and the Foundation For Full Service Banks in 1972.The full service promotion now being used extensively by banks, had been dropped or several years in favor of the approach centering on the ABA jingle ""helping you change things for the better.""""Lee did a great job in getting the ABA the best buy at a time when TV costs were going through the roof,"" commented one ABA official.Mr. Gunderson also has been a strong booster of an Upper Midwest regional advertising approach known as the Bankers Area-wide Advertising Program which coordinates TV advertising by banks in Minnesota, North Dakota, Wisconsin and South Dakota. He has served as past chairman of BAAp as well as its treasurer.In the four years he has been a member of ABA's governing council, the organization's top governing body, the Wisconsin banker has been part of a leadership group tackling an array of issues affecting the industry, ranging from Federal Reserve membership to negotiable order of withdrawal accounts.On NOWs, Mr. gunderson said he has tried to allay the worries of small-city bankers concerning these accounts, insisting that small banks like his own will be able to handle them without undue difficulty.""Sure it scares small banks but you must remember that NOWs are not for everybody. In New England they have been limited to individuals and the experience there taught us that only 20% of the accounts moved into NOWs,"" Mr. Gunderson argues.If a bank prices NOWs properly, there is no reason the accounts should not carry their own weight, he maintained.""If a bank is being asked to start paying interest on demand balances, it only stands to reason that banks will want to recoup their costs by charging fees or minimum balances so that the account carries itself,"" Mr. Gunderson added.If the accounts are properly priced, ""they will be good for the customer,"" said Mr. Gunderson, adding that ""many New England bankers regard the NOW account as a good competitive tool --one of the best they have.""The accounts represent a profitable part of their operations ""and customers like them,"" said Mr. Gunderson who said he familiarized himself with NOWs during a recent trip to New England when he spoke before the Maine Bankers Association.The Wisconsin banker stressed that rural banks will not ""panic"" over NOWs provided they are given all of the relevant information on the accounts, a task which he said the ABA leadership has tried to do.""Small banks are ready to live with NOWs provided there is competitive equity through removal of the savings rate differential,"" he said.As one of his goals during his term, which stretches into 1980-81 when he will become ABA president, Mr. Gunderson said he hopes to be a catalyst in improving the dialogue between the ABA and the Independent Bankers Association of America.He said the industry has too frequently suffered internal clashes which have injured banking in the eyes of legislators.Moreover, some congressman ""like to paly on this divisiveness,"" he charged.The banking industry, Mr. Gunderson noted, faces serious external threats from thrifts and nonbank competitors and thus ""we cannot afford to let our industry be fragmented.""At the same time, Mr. Gunderson said he is not so naive as to think the industry will not have sharp disagreements. He said he hopes these inevitable controversies can be worked out in the spirit of consensus which the ABA leadership has so carefully tried to nurture for the last several years.He said it will be ""premature"" for him to comment on various proposals for amending the 1927 McFadden Act in order to permit regional interstate branching or for altering the 1956 Douglas Amendment on expansion across state lines by multibank holding companies.Mr. Gunderson's potential successor as ABA president-elect in 1980-81 Llewellyn Jenkins, vice chairman of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. of New York, suggested last month the nation should consider experimenting with Douglas to permit banks to compete on a national scale via their holding companies.""This kind of proposal should be evaluated during the consensus process,"" Mr. Gunderson said.When he is not out there pitching for banking, the affable 6'1 Wisconsin banker relaxes by engaging in one of his favorite pastimes -- golf. However, he said, since working on behalf of ABA his handicap has climbed from 16 to 22.""That's my contribution to ABA. Unfortunately, you don't get to play much golf in this circuit,"" he said.Aside from golf, he and his wife, Bonnie, a registered nurse, do manage to take time during summer weekends to sneak up to their northern wisconsin cabin on Big Bear Lake where the family, including their two sons, Jay, 24, and Karl, 20, and a grandchild go boating.The Gundersons own three boats, one of them a runabout which is parked on the front lawn of the Gunderson's modest home in Osceola. Beside the runabout, the Gundersons vacation with their canoe and a fishing boat.Last November the Gundersons celebrated 25 years of marriage. They met in high school in Parker, S.D. Mr. Gunderson is a native of Sioux Falls and Mrs. Gunderson trained as a nurse there. Mr. Gunderson later attended the University of South Dakota and graduated from the University of Wisconsin Graduate School of Banking in Madison.Mr. Gunderson worked in South Dakota banks from 1952 to 1961, moving to Wisconsin in 1961 to become cashier and a director of the Central State Bank, Greenwood, Wis., where he worked before joining the Osceola Bank.Mr. Gunderson said he is enthusiastic about the banking business, ""a profession that I have found extremely satisfying, not just in material ways.""I do not know of anything I would rather do than be a banker. There are a lot of people who cannot say that but I feel fortunate that I can.""Picture, Lee E. Gunderson"
Community Banks Called Well Positioned To Capitalize on Current Mtge. Market,The American Banker,"November 30, 1979, Friday","The $57.3 million-deposit Fremont Bank had a 240% increase in its real estate loan volume in the third quarter of this year over the comparable period of 1978, the result of doubling the size of its real estate staff and aggressively tapping the secondary mortgage market, said Alan L. Hyman, real estate loan officer for the bank.During the Oct. 24-Nov. 2 period, Mr. Hyman said, the bank was able to fund more than $2 million in home loans at 11.63%. Prevailing prime mortgage rates in California currently run from 13% to 14%.The key, he contended, is the willingness to build the experienced staff necessary to take advantage of the secondary market, particularly the market sponsored by government and quasigovernment agencies. These are the Government National Mortgage Association, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Association and Federal National Mortgage Association.""Some community banks have been reluctant to build up the kind of real estate departments necessary to meet FNMA and FHLMC requirements,"" said Mr. Hyman. ""The extra work is expensive and they're afraid that real estate brokers will desert them for bigger lenders when the credit crunch eases.""He said his own bank has had ""a terrific response from local brokers. They know that credit crunch or no credit crunch a community bank can meet their needs and even expedite processing to speed up closing.""The Fremont banker said he recently dispatched a duplicated letter to real estate brokers located in and around this city of 100,000 population, which is near Oakland. He referred to the ""bad news and scare stories"" about the mortgage lending market, such as announcements of lending cutbacks by many financial institutions.In the letter, Mr. Hyman stated that during the next six months, Fremont Bank plans to double its real estate financing volume.""Many smaller banks and savings and loan associations have not aggressively pursued the Federal auction market,"" he contended in the letter and blamed unwillingness to spend the money to train a large real estate department to handle Federal paperwork.""No matter what you may be hearing elsewhere, we have plenty of mortgage money to lend,"" he told the real estate brokers. He invited them to call him at home on weekends if they have deals to discuss.The American Bankers Association has mounted an effort during the past few years to better acquaint banks of all sizes with the secondary mortgage market. A recent ABA publication entitled How to Market a Mortgage includes a section on the most likely market sources for smaller banks.The publication pointed out that the ""general impression that a bank must be relatively large"" before it can effectively use the secondary market ""is not necessary accurate."" More important than size is ""the amount of mortgage activity it can generate and the adequacy of its mortgage staff and relationship with mortgage experts.""The booklet noted that FNMA is able to handle ""relatively small commitment levels"" and that FHLMC, while originally designed for S&Ls, ""now offers extensive programs for commercial banks.""It further suggested that ""small banks may find that their large city correspondents may be of assistance, either in direct purchase or in helping to arrange purchase.""This may be especially true, it said, if the city correspondent maintains a trust department mortgage pool arrangement aimed at pension fund investments or has connections with a real estate investment trust."
Charleston Savings Celebrates 125th Anniversary with Community Services,The American Banker,"August 13, 1979, Monday","The first was a city-wide arts competition which the bank co-sponsored with the Boston School Department. The theme of the competition was ""That's My Boston (the bank's slogan is ""That's My Bank"") and it was positioned as a celebration of both the International Year of the Child and the anniversary. The second project was designed to tiein with the rehabilitation of the downtown retail district in which the bank's new headqurters is located. In order to attract the people to the refurbished area, while calling attention to its own anniversary, the bank sponsored a week-long series of activities from June 11-15 at its 55 Summer Street Plaza. Juggling, mime and jazz were included in the week of festivities.Thirty eight high and middle school students and 21 elementary classes from all parts of Boston have been notified that they were winners in the arts competition.More than $9,000 in prize money was awarded to the winners of the competition, which invited students in all grade levels to describe through visual media of their choice some aspect or element of life in the city that is of particular interest to them.Nearly 350 individual and class projects were submitted. Media included photography, fabric hangings, sculpture, ceramics, oil paints, watercolors, murals, posters, and many others.""Needless to say, we are extremely proud to have served as the catalyst for all of this creative effort by the school children of Boston,"" said Robert W. Garver, president of Charlestown Savings. ""We wanted to celebrate our 125th anniversary in a way that would bring some happiness and pleasure to the city and its people, to whom charlestown Savings owes its existence. The kids used this competition as a way to say 'We love you, Boston,' and we are glad to have been able to give them the opportunity to say it."""
CRA Offers Banks Opportunity to Send Branch Managers Out to Communities,The American Banker,"May 1, 1979, Tuesday","Frank Dellomo, president of the $1.3 billion-deposit Brooklyn Saving Bank, made that point at a seminar held by the Savings Banks Association of New York State at the New York Athletic Club. Branch managers at his bank are required to spend one day a week in their communities, to propose CRA-related projects for their communities at the start of each year, and in some cases to hold open houses twice a year, he said.Mr. Dellomo explained in an interview that he thought banks' marketing staff members and branch managers should work more closely together. Head of a newly formed marketing and operations subcommitte of the association, he reccommended that banks employ a team effort on CRA, including in it mortgage and marketing officers and branch managers.In a similar vein, Katherine Corigliano, examiner with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. in New York, suggested that bankers should actively seek out their communities and told the savings bankers that ""affirmative action is now your responsibility.""Mr. Dellomo said branch managers ta his bank play an important role on CRA because they know their communities. The one-day-a-week requirement was begun a year ago for the purpose of developing new business. CRA matters have since been added to the objectives of the community visits, which must be documented in quarterly reports, Mr. Dellomo said.Also, branch managers were fully briefed, during a three-day seminar, on the bank's CRA statement, mortgage policy and criteria, and position on redlining.This was part of a comprehensive motivational program purchased from a Chicago consulting firm.Mr. Dellomo recommended at the seminar that banks considering CRA projects look for meaningful contributions.One Brooklyn Savings branch helped form a block association in a community where a robbery had occured. The bank played an advisory, not direct, role and provided meeting space in the branch office and mimeographing facilities.Another branch plans to sponsor next February a minimarathon race of high school students, with proceeds going for a sports physiology lab at a high school.Cost to the bank will be about $4,000, Mr. Dellomo said.The bank's CRA officer tracks project costs and keeps minutes and attendance lists of related meetings.Another seminar participant, Richard Creviston, president of the $195.6 million-deposit Svings Bank of New London, Conn., described his bank's effort to rehabilitate a single block of rundown housing on Starr Street, New London. The bank is spending about $230,000 acquiring 19 of the 21 homes on the block and about $900,000 or restoration, and worked closely with the city, which is investing $450,000 for new underground utilities, Mr. Creviston said. The bank received nine boarded-up properties from the citythe effort is having the desired effect of creating a renaissance in the surrounding area, where restored homes are selling for about $80, 000 apiece. The area contains homes located near the central business district, built in Greek Revival and victorian syle during the city's height as a whaling center.A marketing officeial fo the bank told the seminar the bank bought the homes ""very quietly."" Another bank official said it was very difficult to obtain insurance on the home. Mr. Creviston explained after the meeting that the carrier which insures the bank ultimately provided the coverage --after a $4,000 chain-link fence was erectred around the block, a security patrol provided at $500 a week, and a $3,000 feasibility study commissioned.The bank president added that the Connecticut Housing Finance Authority committed $1 million for take-out mortgages at 7.5% interest.Mr. Creviston said the bank hoped to break even on the project. Noting the rewards of the project, the knowledge it had facilitated real benefits to its community.An Exception to the good publicity was a newspaper article about a displaced family. The Family fought ecviction in court but finally was ejected, after several months.the city helped displaced tenants find housing and utilized substantial Federal Uniform Relocation Assistance funds. The Savings Bank of New London granted a mortgage to a displaced tenant, enabling him to become a homeowner in a adjacent area, Mr. Creviston noted.Two property owners on the block are staying and rehabilitating their homes with 3.5% loans funded through the Federal Community Development Block Grant program. Buyers of the 19 renovated homes must promise to live there for two years.The bank is preparing a duocumentary film about the project.In addition, Paul A. Willax, president of the the $1.7 billion-deposit Erie Savings Bank, Buffalo, N.Y. described his bank's Neighborhood Improvement Program. NIP, targeted to transitional neighborhoods, shows prospective borrowers how to apply for loans, assists them in applying and expedites the applications.An Erie Savings official explained the bank encourages demand by informing residents that funds are available, explaining loan criteria and inviting the residents to explore the possibilities of loans. He said no statistics were available to show any increase of lending as a result of NIP but noted that market surveys showed the bank's image had clearly improved in the year-old program.Ms. Corigllano recommended that banks use creative marketing, like the mobile home ownership counseling center of the $1.2 billion-deposit City Federal Savings and Loan Association, Elizabeth, N.J., and participation in the Columbia University extension course. the Dynamics of Neighborhood ACtivsim.Also at the seminar, Fred Rider, director of the cinderella program of the Brookyn Union Gas Co., told the bankersthat involvement in housing rehabilitation ""isn't headache -- it's an opportunity.""In an interview, he said about 40 homes have been rehabilitated since Cinderella started in 1966. Brooklyn Union provides some landscaping, gas heating systems and gaslight on Cinderella project in partnership with savings or commercial banks, which provide rehabnilitation and permanent financing.Mr. Rider said only abandoned properties in viable neighborhoods art considered for cinderella's traditional focus on brownstones might be expanded in the long run to include cooperative apartments, and the program might be expanded from Brooklyn and laurelton, Staten Island.In the first 10 years of Cinderella projects, the gas company spent about $400,000, excluding advertising, he said. It also has operated a brownstone information center and stated an annual brownstone fair."
"Citizens NB, Paintsville, Ky., Finds Maps Benefit Community and Its Ad Potential",The American Banker,"January 16, 1979, Tuesday","""I'd had a great many inquiries,"" Mr. Dorton said, ""from the bank's depositors and area citizens which prompted me to seek a source for a new Paintsville-Johnson County map. The local business community was anxious for a tool with which to chart their new business expansion,"" he said.After reading about K.D. Stearley ADvertising, Louisville, which had created a map program for Union National Bank of Barbourville, Ky., Mr. Dorton commissioned the firm to produce the Paintsville-Johnson County map.""The maps have had a very good recep""tion,"" Mr. Dorton said. ""A sizeable number of people have come to the bank in person to request copies. Since our name and various bank locations are featured prominently on the map, we find that it makes a good daily advertising piece.""Nancy Brugh, administrative assistant to the president, noted that map distribution could easily be targeted to achieve maximum advertising benefit for the bank. ""The maps will be given primarily to individuals or businesses who open new accounts,"" she said. Already, she added, many requests have been generated through word of mouth.""We had a map, previously,"" Mr. Dorton said, ""but it was inadequate for the bank's use simply because it was so outdated.""The new map is printed in forest green on ivory paper and pinpoints major industries, schools, hospitals, public buildings and points of interest as well as the Citizens National Bank locations.A unique feature of $49 million-deposit Citizen National's program -- and one which required extensive city and county research -- was the new Paintsville Lake Project, a 12,930 acre lake area which Paintsville business is awaiting for the help it should bring in generating tourism dollars.Although the lake is in preliminary development stages, it is featured on the map as if it were complete. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers was consulted to position the lake accurately and to scale. Numerous tints show the seasonal pool area, public access areas and the real estate acquisition line area."
Pittsburgh S&L Community Celebration Takes Place of Savings Advertising,The American Banker,"August 7, 1979, Tuesday","Second objective: to heighten community awareness of Pittsburgh's fourth largest savings and loan association in a period of heavy competitive advertising.How, Friendship Federal Savings and Loan Association officials asked themselves, could they make their voice heard above everyone else in the bid for capital and public awareness?""In June,"" said Robert McCullough, Manager of Marketing of the 281 million dollar savings institution, ""when talk about changes in rate structure for savers got serious, we told our ad agency of record, Mediagraphics, that local savings institutions would be shouting the changes and we wanted our voice heard above all the others. We knew that every competitor's advertising would focus on premiums or the actual numerical percentage. We wanted something that would make us a little different. We did not want that stereotyped financial ad. We knew we didn't have the budget to outlast the others. The question was, 'What else can we do?'""In reply, Mediagraphics, a Pittsburgh-based advertising firm, prepared a Savers Celebration. ""It was originally called Small Savers Celebration,"" said Mr. McCullough, ""but we deleted the word, small. All savers are potentially small savers. Even the customer with thousands of dollars in certificates can buy a small denomination certificate.""The Savers Celebration is designed to be more than an advertising tool say its creators. It was conceived to be ""an event."" The new rates are here. Don't look at it negatively, they advised. The saver gets a break with higher interest, and Friendship's holding a month-long celebration. View it in a positive light. Make it a happy time for everybody. Have parades, popcorn, balloons, prizes, premiums, and fun.""The really unique part of our program, in addition to the celebration concept,"" Mr. McCullough explained, ""is that other institutions run ads, they might decorate offices, give premiums, etc. That's very typical. It seems like they keep everything inside. Our agency suggested we get out . Have parades that go out into the community. Tell your story outside. Generate conversation. Have people say, 'What's going on?' 'What're they doing?'. 'How great,' or even 'How weird.' We're going out into the community as opposed to simply expecting them to come in. I may be wrong but I don't think there's ever been a savings and loan or a bank that's had a parade in Pittsburgh. If they did though they didn't have an airplane complete with siren and banner.""Between July 16 and July 23, the Steel City Stompers, a locally-known six-man band, a drum majorette, a fashion model, and a car carrying a barker and loudspeaker were transported on a 28-foot-long flatbed truck over routes covering a three-mile radius surrounding each of Friendship's eleven offices. And an airplane, siren blaring and banner announcing ""Free Popcorn Today At Friendship Federal"" circled over all.Each office is decorated, inside and out, with bunting and posters, and hot popcorn and helium-filled ballons abound.In addition to the standard premiums of pots, cutlery, and canisters for customers opening accounts or adding to existing accounts, Friendship is offering $100 worth of gasoline at each office and one grand prize of a new Chevy Chevette. Drawings for the gas and auto were scheduled for Monday. Anyone may submit entry blanks. Premiums will be offered until September 30.Advertising began on July 9 and was preceded by analysis of the differences in market and media conditions for each geographic area of Friendship's widespread offices. Branches were grouped into ""clusters"" based upon similarities in competition, growth potential, market share, and media coverage and costs, for example. Media coverage includes: a week-long television ""blitz"" promotion beginning on July 9 to advertise the ""celebration;"" radio commercials and newspaper ads broadcasting the new rates, the celebration, parade schedules, and, in the last week of July, ""Better Hurry"" ads announcing the closing date for submission of entry forms for prizes. Direct mail flyers were also sent to existing customers.Cost of the total campaign, Mr. McCullough reported, is 31% of the annual marketing budget. He declined to state a dollar value.Although Friendship officials feel that the Savers Celebration is probably their most innovative advertising effort to date, they describe themselves as having been ""moderately innovative"" promotion-wise in the past. ""I think we were one of the first savings and loans in the area to have an account executive,"" said the marketing manager. ""Our experimentation with solar energy systems in our 3 newest offices has had strong promotional impact and we've also been somewhat innovative in our construction of 3 prefabricated fiberglass modular offices.""We are definitely interested in taking the innovative approach,"" Mr. McCullough continued. ""That's why in August, 1978 we switched our advertising account to an agency that did not have another financial organization among its clients. Their ideas were fresh and creative, different. We were looking for something different. We felt our ads until then looked like everyone else's. We did not want to look like any other financial institution in advertising. Mediagraphics came in with a whole new theme for the entire association. The theme line is Getting Closer to You. The theme line for the Savers Celebration is Hooray for You and, we feel, fits right into our overall approach.""Will Friendship accomplish its mission? Mr. McCullough thinks so. ""Sure,"" he said, ""or we wouldn't be in it.Remember, though, our primary objectives are to stop the outward flow of $2 million in savings dollars and attract 1.6 million into the fixed term certificate accounts. April, May, and June were negative savings months similar to trends in 1974. July, August, and September have also been negative in recent years. Personally, I don't think the recent outflow is related to disintermediation. I think the cost of living is increasing at such a rate that people are withdrawing their money to live on. But we're also suffering, of course, because of the increased interest rates on savings, the lowering of amounts allowable for certificates, and our loss of advantage over commercial banks in terms of 6-month money market certificates.""Our secondary objective is to heighten the public's recognition of Friendship Federal so where we may not be able to reach the maximum objective in terms of money flow, we feel there will be a significant benefit in raising the community's awareness of us. At each office, crowds were waiting for the parade to arrive. So it's working very well so far. I haven't seen any figures yet but just for exposure it's already been successful."""
Italian Savings Banks Meet Communities' Needs,The American Banker,"August 1, 1979, Wednesday","Considering that local economies have different points of view regarding their social and economic goals, and that the choice of management policy is effective only when it is tailored to territorial needs and conditions, it is clearly understood how savings banks' particular way of acting has exerted an influence on Italian reality as a whole, and not only on the Italian economy.When we speak about Italian savings banks' role and perspectives, we must not forget to look into the components of the country's economic situation which have in the last years influenced the activity of these institutions -- first of all, monetary inflation, which has caused difficult problems for savings banks managements; then, the crisis in some productive sectors where savings banks have traditionally operated (particularly the building industry, a field hard hit in the whole country with extremely serious social consequences); and also the contraction of private investments and the deficiencies and delays in public investments, which have limited savings banks' activities in support of productive services.As for public investments, the typical Italian problem is a public administrative establishment unable to keep in line with the economic and social situation. The slowness of public expenditure where public building and social structures are concerned and the bureaucratic obstacles to entrepreneurial enterprises have constituted relevant concomitant causes of economic crisis since the available resources were not exploited at the right time, aggravating employment problems.Nevertheless, savings banks have succeeded in keeping prices under control in spite of inflation, ensuring for their clients lower costs of money than other credit institutions, by means of positive cooperation with monetary authorities regarding stabilization measures.They have supported the economic sectors in a more precarious situation (mainly agriculture and building industry); they have particularly concentrated on helping small and medium-sized enterprises and have acquired indisputed merit in financing a great number of public works, schools, hospitals, service networks, acting quickly and covering the total demand of special credits through their own special sections and consortia. They have, finally, contributed substantially to keeping unaltered the institutional structures by sustaining the local enterprises and by taking upon themselves as public economic bodies, burdens which are peculiar to the fiscal system.The above considerations do not treat fully the subject of the economic components conditioning savings banks' activity. We have left out matters of primary importance like the relationship between credit and monetary policy, the local finances, the credit facilities, the relationship between banking policy and economic planning, because it would take too long, to the prejudice of the main theme -- namely, the operational prospects of savings banks.If it is true that the clouds that had thickened over the Italian economy have not yet cleared away, we may, however, reasonably trust that they will in the future.The growing economic and commercial importance of the Mediterranean area, the new opportunities for working abroad offered to our firms, the measures for domestic energy policy and the recent agreements with African States, the substantial modifications which are occurring in the public administrative establishment with the transfer to regional governments and local bodies of administrative powers once centralized, are all encouraging events which give grounds for a reversing trend of Italian economy in a positive direction.In this framework, savings banks are given a very important role -- that is, a welding function between economic policy and economic structure.Of course, the economic crisis cannot be overcome with individual efforts of institutions or social organizations: what is necessary is a common harmonized effort of all social, economic, political, cultural and working forces, and the consequent giving up of individual and group antagonism. It is also necessary to emphasize more and more the value of personal engagement and responsibility, to define the position of the institutions and social organizations holding public responsibilities and to carry out the relative programs with industry and spirit to sacrifice.No doubt savings banks will contribute effectively to the renewal of Italian society, coherently turning into operational practice the inspiring principles of their peculiar presence in the banking system. Such an ambitious role involves manifold responsibilities toward private saving, which has to be secured and emphasized; towards the economic activities supported, since the development or the contraction of a particular economic activity will depend upon the kind of investments made; towards the representative bodies of the community, for the technical assistance savings banks will give at the stage of scheduling and realizing public interventions.Speaking about deposit collection, it is necessary to remember that many factors have an impact on it. Some concerning the subjective aspect depend also on the saver's age and profession; others show in macro-economic terms, the allotment of national income, the dynamics of consumption, the interest rates, the taxation system. With reference to collection, deeply innovative events have recently happened: the contribution to saving from enterprises and the public administration has lessened, while the contribution from the households has become preeminent and, in Italy, exceeds that of all countries that are members of the European Community.In light of such important changes, savings banks intend saving collection policy not only in the sense of promoting and spreading the idea of security, but, above all, in terms of qualifying the provision by relating it to investments.Savings banks' intermediary function consists essentially of investing the saving locally collected in local projects. The saver-client must see with his own eyes the results of his saving in the shape of a school, a work of public utility, in support of the local economic activities he feels in accordance with the territorial needs.Then, savings banks' investments, brought back to the deepest motivations of personal and familiar saving, will realize true democracy among savers, getting them involved in the evaluation of the goals of the bank, which will appear an essential element of the economic structure, devoted not to profit but to the commitment of social welfare.As for investments, we must state before hand that discretional choices are considerably limited. Public authorities managing economies, in fact, prefer credit among the instruments of economic policy, and in Italy the decisions on bank investments are strongly conditioned by the directives of governative organs realized through various means -- namely, limits to the compulsory reserves, allotments of credit, and credit facilities.The problem savings banks have to face is the relationship between credit to production and credit to public bodies. Savings banks were accused of withdrawing resources from the productive system to finance public bodies. Also envisaged was the specialization of banks in view of such credit distinctions and it was suggested that savings banks might grant credit to public bodies only, while other credit institutions would be competent to finance productive activities.The results of the last congress of savings banks have done justice to this idea, and asserted the need not only to keep the present institutional structure of savings banks, but also to widen their operational activities. It has been considered that there is no contrast between financing a public body or a productive enterprise, taking into account both the tasks fulfilled by public bodies in the field of public works, infrastructures, social services, and the fact that public interventions comply with the demands of productive enterprises which need public works (transports, supplies, etc.) to carry out their activities. A contrast, therefore, cannot exist; on the contrary, financing public bodies matches well with financing productive enterprises in the outlook of the social economic development of the whole country.Another problem regarding investments concerns sectorial choices: it is the great theme of an economic debate developed particularly about southern policy.Taking into consideration the fundamental productive activities, shall we concentrate on industrialization, on agriculture or on tourism? And which sector will be given priority?Undoubtedly, the lack of industrial structures does not allow an economic take-off from the land; anyway, tourism and agriculture as well are of primary importance.The problem does not consist of fixing principles of importance or priority among the various economic activities, but in intervening for a coordinated development of the different sectors within which it is necessary to effect priority choices. If we refer, for instance, to the industry sector, it is absolutely necessary in Italy to exploit building industry and leave out investments in other industrial sectors.As for agriculture, it may be worth supporting a certain activity, in a general view of the national and community situation, while a different one might have no prospects. As for tourism, valid economic choices are possible in this sector according to whether we are able to take into account the trends of the great touristic streams moving at an international level, or not. Besides, recent investigations on programming methods have emphasized the necessity of abandoning the sectorial standards in favor of a way of programming within one particular sector, allowing scientifically elaborated choices to be made.As far as savings banks are concerned, if sectorial choices cannot qualify investments, there is a trend to adopt standards which allow the best allocation of resources.In their policy, savings banks are aware that the problems of economic development are also linked to great themes such as ecology, the rational exploitation of energy resources, and the respect for the environment.An economic system favoring an indiscriminately productive system, in contrast with the eco-system demands, is the outcome of an illusion about the inexhaustibility of the resources and, what is worse, it forebodes an indesirable future for all of us.We can, therefore, qualify credit by supporting activities which are productive of real wealth, do not destroy irrationally the resources, have regard for the environment, do not prejudice any other equally useful activities, respond to territorial demands, and, finally, take into account the need for development and the cultural traditions of the community.In support of such activities, credit must also estimate, for a higher qualification, the chances of employment it can offer.Which of these considerations link the activity of savings banks, as economic public bodies, to the best goals of depositors-savers? The investments effected to favor the economic development of the community, without having to pay a high price in terms of worse living standards (just think of pollution), correspond to the hopes of savers, who see their sacrifices appraised in view of the desirable development of the community they belong to.The last problem concerning investments is the contrast between credit to small-and medium-sized enterprises and credit to large enterprises. In Italy, especially with credit facilities, the former have been sacrificed, compared to the latter, for various reasons -- namely, the stronger contractual power with reference to the guarantees they can offer to banks and the stronger political force owing also to the larger number of employees.Savings banks have indeed always favored the small-and medium-sized industries, considering that they correspond -- as they have shown with their extraordinary adaptability to the economic crisis -- to the ideal size of an enterprise.But for small-and medium-sized enterprises, other measures are necessary -- in particular, legislative measures.One of the most important problems to solve is that of guarantees: it is a matter involving the whole credit system and that cannot be solved by savings banks only.Anyway, savings banks already lean towards granting their credit not only with patrimonial guaranties, but with different kinds of guarantees, through new legal instruments (i.e., credit consortia), responding to the requirement of banking managements, and allowing small-and medium-sized enterprises to get into the credit system.It is clear that savings banks need to keep in touch with the institutions sharing political responsibility in the territory. Such communication is necessary for the decisions on economic policy these institutions have to make both in the programming phase, for the assistance banks can give, and in the realization phase, so that credit might be used in the strategic and organic view of development.The planned reform of communal and provincial laws regarding the administrative functions in general, and in matters of great economic relevance in the various sectors, offers many and various opportunities for savings banks' presence.It is evident that the operational horizon of banks has to be widened (no longer in the prospect of mere credit intermediation and of the services offered to private clients), and that the prejudice -- to tell the truth, fully justified until now -- of the ineluctable inefficiency of the public administrative machine has to be abandoned. On this account, the connections with public administrations have been considered, until now, almost contaminating for the efficiency of a bank (which would not be in a position to sustain the hindrances of bureaucratism in its organization). If the public administrative activities will comply with programming and efficiency, the presence of a territorial bank might be useful to meet the organizational and functional requirements of the bodies operating in the country and to assist them in the choice of economic policies they have to make in a programming phase.The regions have been entrusted with tasks of social development to be realized through economic planning and coordination of the administrative activities of the various government bodies, which undoubtedly involves a connection with the banking system.Savings banks differentiate from other credit institutions, owing to the fact that -- in the stage of planning and determining their administrative regional behav iours, for the information they have at their disposal and the techniques they hold, and at the operational executive state (preparation of financial instruments and other services, like leasing) --they intend to undertake an extremely important task in realizing the public administrative aims. From the banks' point of view as well, the opportunity for a socially perfect destination of the available resources in an organic context, as far as possible, and the consequent achievement of the so called ""allocative"" efficiency require the connection between banks and bodies which, being representative of the communities, have been given institutional duties of social and economic development.And this firm belief gains even more strength if we consider that to the public discipline of entrepreneurial activity, provided by article 41 of the Italian constitution, corresponds the incontestable public pre-eminence of credit decisions.The problem is not to finance public bodies for general expenses, but to realize a profitable connection between public activities and credit interventions, in the belief that there are common problems both in the local territory administrations and in the banking system: for savings banks, the internal aim is to be able to work out syntheses and judgments on the principal economic themes having an influence on the concrete actions effected, so as to provide a scientific basis, not only for internal management decisions, but also externally, in favor of all the bodies operating in the country.Of course, savings banks cannot be included in the unfortunately common judgment which considers the banks isolated from the social and territorial context, unconcerned about social problems and even gaining advantage if they grow worse, and devoted only to their own particular profit.Indeed, savings banks have never been indifferent to the problems of economic and social development of the land where they operate, and have given their contribution to solve them.General problems reflect also on business management: problems related to the employment of young people and the public order being frequently shaken by crimes, cause constant anxiety in the people responsible for the direction of a bank.To solve these problems, a coordinated effort is clearly needed.It is also necessary that the responsible persons of public institutions appreciate other people's cooperation and abandon the jealous defense of the prerogatives and attributions they enjoy.It is, above all, necessary for the legal and administrative powers to be aware of the role played by the banking system and by savings banks, in particular. On the other hand, savings banks must be aware of the need for cooperation with other credit institutions operating in the country, taking into account their operational possibilities."
"Ohio, Mass. Mergers Approved on community Lending Commitments;
Fed Obtains Pledge",The American Banker,"June 6, 1979, Wednesday","The commitment was required in response to a challenge by the Greater Toledo Housing Coalition, which had charged that Ohio Citizens had failed to meet the credit needs of families in such areas -- "" particularly in black neighborhoods."" The Board considered the challenge under the Community Rein vestment Act, which allows anyone to challenge applications for expansion of banks or savings and loan associations on the basis of the institutions' records of meeting the credit needs of their communities.Although the Fed review ""did not reveal any intent or effort to discourage loan demand from low- to moderate-income neighborhoods,"" the Board decision said Ohio Citizens had not made a ""sufficient effort"" to lend in these areas.""We are pleased that the Federal Reserve Board recognized that Ohio Citizens' lending record was not satisfactory, but what is important to us is results,"" Jean Peterman, project coordinator of the Greater Toledo Housing Coalition, said. She promised ""to continue to watch their lending record."" A spokesman for the bank did not want to comment until he had seen the full decision.The board cited increased convenience and services to area customers as some of the benefits of a merger. Ohio Citizens' higher lending limit, mobile home financing, trust and cash management services were among the benefits the Board review noted. Also, the Board concluded, ""the proposed transaction would have no significant adverse effects on competition in the relevant market.""In its complaint, the coalition charged that data obtained under the 1975 Mortgage Disclosure Act showed Toledo's ""racially diverse neighborhoods"" did not receive a significant share of Ohio Citizens mortgage loans.""There are 37 census tracts which received no mortgage loans in 1977,"" a coalition press release said. ""Sixty-six per cent of the black population of the toledo area lives in those tracts. In contrast, 16 census tracts, all in suburban or outlying areas, received 50% of all mortgage loans by dollar amount.""In a similar Ohio commitment, the $228.1 million-deposit First Federal Savings and Loan Association, Cleveland, recently reached an agreement with the city's mayor, Dennis J. Kucinich, promising more mortgage and home improvement loans to that city's residents. First Federal agreed to a goal of lending $15 million in two years to city residents."
Community Group Asks Illinois S&L To Repeat Citizen's Fin. Workshops,The American Banker,"March 26, 1979, Monday","In addition to English, Mr. Valli spoke in Italian and German and Mr. Guttierrez in Spanish. Topics covered in the 90-minute sessions were home buying, home financing, and home improvements.Theme of the initial program was ""Tools Needed to Buy a Home."" It covered the following: Learn about the neighborhood. How does your price compare with others in the area? What can your budget afford? Down payment? Monthly payment? What costs will you incur? Construction tips. Steps to take toward purchase.The second session involved hints on how to go about financing; ratio of value to loan; ratio of income to monthly payment; suggested reserve to have on hand; what to avoid when borrowing, and how to shop for a loan.the final presentation covered home maintenance and financing: How to obtain a home improvement loan. What type of loan is best for you? Repairs or additions? Need to avoid too many payments and too-high payments.Although some questions from the floor after each program were expected, Mr. Valli found two question-and-answer sessions lasted more than an hour.Particular interest was expressed in six-month money market certificates, rates on which are geared to those on 26-month Treasury bills. Listeners wanted to know about renewal rates in particular.Other questions involved how rates are calculated and how to obtain the lowest cost for the biggest loan. Some asked information about room additions and recommended limits for expenditures.Mr. Valli pointed out that room additions were Land of Lincoln's number one activity in 1978. They accounted for 16.4% of all improvement loans made by the nine-office, $360 million-assetassociation and nudged ahead of central air conditioning, the usual leader, he said."
Customer Service Should Be Tailored To Community Needs,The American Banker,"July 25, 1979, Wednesday","In survey after survey, office location has been shown to be the number one factor in the consumers' decision to select one bank over another. Originally, C&S sought to meet the challenge of location by substantially enlarging its network of offices. More recently the bank has expanded its system of automated teller machines throughout Georgia. One additional move to improve convenience was to open a significant number of the banking offices on Saturdays. The customer response has been strong, and the Saturday banks are growing at a rate which exceeds the regular five-day offices.For some customers, convenience takes on a more specialized meaning. In one area of Atlanta where there is a concentration of Spanish speaking people, not only are most employees of the branch office bilingual, but the automated teller machines located there offer their instructions in both English and Spanish. Perhaps for this reason, the machines in this location are among the most heavily used in the entire state.Convenient service of a specialized sort was also extended to blind Georgians with the introduction of Braille checking accounts. In these accounts, the blind person is provided with a guide for check writing and with a method for entering amounts in Braille on the check stub. At month-end, a statement printed in Braille is included along with a regular statement in case help is needed from a sighted friend.Yet another customized service relates to the vast areas of timberland across Georgia. Timber can be very valuable if it is properly managed. C&S has added a full-time forester to the staff to help customers maximize the yield from their land holdings.But while convenience for customers with special needs is important, it is no less important that the bank offer services which will satisfy the needs of all our customers. How often has a young person said, ""How can I get credit when everyone refuses me credit because I don't have any previous credit experience?"" It's a good question and a real opportunity for a bank. For the college-aged student with no previous credit history, C&S offers a limited credit card line with parental guarantee. The student has the opportunity to handle credit, and the bank has the opportunity to develop a long-term customer. Perhaps in the future, that same student can be offered a larger line of credit related to the charge card or can be offered a pre-approved, unsecured line of credit which C&S calls ""Ready Money.""In the long range, however, meeting the needs of the customer is more than making bank services and locations convenient. It also means aiding Georgia communities and the people in them to live better lives. It means involvement in neighborhood revitalization programs, making mortgage money available to revive older, decaying areas of our cities. It means helping people understand what banking services exist to help them by being involved in consumer education, financial planing, and small business seminars. And as a large employer of Georgia citizens, it means adopting and implementing a strong affirmative action program in hiring and promoting. The banking relationship is only one of the relationships between a banking institution and its customers.Needs are met through responsiveness, and a bank can respond if it is aware of what the consumer wants. Recently C&S has begun testing a comment card which asks for direct feedback on our performance. We believe these comments will be extremely useful in measuring customer reaction to our products and our service as well as providing direct communication between policy makers and customers. As environments and lifestyles change, so do customer needs. A bank, therefore, must readily adapt when necessary if it is to truly meet customer needs. At C&S we're trying to do that. After all, ""customer service"" begins with C&S.Picture, BENNET A. BROWN"
Fed Consumer Unit Revamped,The American Banker,"December 17, 1979, Monday","The reorganized division focuses responsibility in the division for coordination of Board activities under all Federal community development programs.Ms. Janet Hart continues as Director of the division.

Kluckman, Associate Director of the division, has been assigned primary responsibility for coordinating the Board's community affairs activities, in addition to his existing responsibilities.The reorganized division's community affairs unit will assist other Board divisions in administering the Board's Regulation BB -- implementing the Community Reinvestment Act -- as well as Board activities under:The National Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation;The Commercial Reinvestment Task Force, andThe Interagency Staff Task Force on Urban Credit.The reorganized division's community affairs unit will also maintain liason with, and assist CRA officers at the Reserve banks who have been designated as contacts for community organizations and banks with respect to community development and revitalization matters.The division will continue to administer the Board's responsibilities, designated by the Congress, for rulewriting or enforcement under 10 consumer credit protection laws. These are Truth in Lending, Fair Credit Billing, Consumer Leasing, Equal Credit Opportunity, Home Mortgage Disclosure, Federal Trade Commission Improvement Act (unfair or deceptive practices), Fair Housing, Fair Credit Reporting, Fair Debt Collection Practices and Electronic Fund Transfer."
A Warning Note on CRA,The American Banker,"November 2, 1979, Friday","Furthermore, as of that date, all such financial institutions were required to have available for the public a copy of their Community Reinvestment Act statement, which inlcuded a description of the so-called local community, a map of the local community, the types of credit to be extended to the public, and the ways in which the financial institution was attempting to meet the credit needs of the local and moderate income neighborhoods. That was the state of the law as of Feb. 6, 1979.The following is a reflection of practical attempts by this college professor and financial consultant to obtain such Community Reinvestment Act statements from midwestern commercial banks and savings and loans in recent weeks. The following dialog is typical:Consultant: ""Good afternoon. May I please have a copy of your Community Reinvestment Act statement?""Secretary: Excuse me. did you say a brochure on our IRA accounts?""Consultant: ""No ma'am. A copy of your Community Reinvestment Act statement. A statement that you are required to have for public inspection as of Feb. 6, 1979.""Secretary: ""I'm sorry. I am not certain of what you are speaking. Please have a seat and I'll find out for you.""One, three, 10 minutes pause, depending upon the efficiency of the staff.Bank Officer: ""Here you are, sir.""Consultant: ""No, this is a copy of the public notice. I would like to have a complete copy of the Community Reinvestment Act statement. It is a statement of the services you offer, the types of credit you extend and the map delineating your local community.""Bank Officer: ""I am sorry, but I thought that was what you requested. ""I'll have to check with Mr. Smith, our vice president. Won't you have a seat? Mr. Smith will be with you in a moment. I'm not certain where the Community Reinvestment Act statement is; however, I am sure that Mr. Smith will be able to get you a copy.""Vice President: ""Good afternoon. I am Mr. Smith. Who are you and who do you represent?""Consultant: ""I'm a member of the public requesting copy of your Community Reinvestment Act statement.""After further inquisition as to who specifically you are, and who specifically you represent, and for what specific reason you are requesting the CRA statement, Mr. Smith states that he thinks he has a copy around somewhere, probably on the president's desk.Vice President: ""Do I have to have the map attached to the back of it, or would you have it without the map? Or would you just like a copy of the public notice? We have that hanging in the lobby.""Consultant: ""No, I don't want the public notice. That's simply a form that the Federal regulatory agencies have forced you to hang on the wall. However, I would like a copy of what you have claimed is your lending community, and what you determined to be the types of credit you are going to extend, and what you plan to do in order to meet the credit needs of your community. You are required by law, as of Feb. 6, 1979, to have that statement available to the public.""Finally a copy of the statement is obtained.I wish the above was imaginary. Unfortunately, it isn't. Over the past month, in connection with several bank branch applications, protests, and one bank merger in Michigan and Ohio, my staff and I have had the opportunity to request Community Reinvestment Act statements from many banks. The reception that we have received has been hostile, at best. In most cases, the personnel at the banks do not even know what the Community Reinvestment Act statement is, do not have copies available to the public, and the bankers are in deep throes of paranoia concerning the Community Reinvestment Act. Based upon a relatively small sample of appproximately 20 commercial banks and savings and loans in Ohio and Michigan, this writer is of the opinion that almost all are in non-conformity with the CRA, and most are doing their best to ignore the statutory provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act.This comment is written as a warning to those commercial bankers throughout the United States who believe there is a neighborhood coalition around every corner, and a neighborhood uprising in every block. As your examinations go on during 1979 and 1980, you are going to be increasingly penalized by the examiners who find that there are not sufficient copies of the Community Reinvestment Act statement available at every office, and that your staff is not cognizant of what the Community Reinvestment Act statement is. The Community Reinvestment Act provides each of you the opportunity to tell the community what area you consider to be the area in which you lend, what types of credit you extend, and implicitly what types of credit you do not extend, and what attempts you are making as a financial institution to meet the needs and convenience of the public, especially low and moderate income neighborhoods.If my travels throughout the Midwest are typical of banks throughout the United States, and I do not assume that they are, then my experience has been very unfortunate in this regard. The Community Reinvestment Act does not require the person (public) to say who he or she happens to be or whom he represents and the bank has no authority to require the person requesting the Community Reinvestment Act statement to explain for what purpose he desires a copy of the statement. Attempts by bank management and/or staff to dissuade individuals from obtaining CRA statements are not in the banking industry's best interest. What's more, since most geographical locations within the United States do not have potentially adverse CRA impacts, what can be gained by being uncooperative?Of the 14,000 banks and 8,000 savings and loan associations covered by the CRA, less than two dozen have been challenged by any organized or unorganized group since the enactment of the Community Reinvestment Act. Why then won't the commercial bankers conform to the regulations forced upon them by the Federal legislation? One reason is a basic distrust of the Community Reinvestment Act and its purposes, and the other is, of course, a response to the mass media and grapevine dispatches of the banking industry itself.My only warning to the commercial bankers of the United States is that reluctance to disclose the Community Reinvestment Act statement, failure of the staff to be informed as to what the Community Reinvestment Act statement is, failure to have sufficient copies available for the public and a basic thirddegree-interview context whenever a Community Reinvestment Act statement is requested, are bound, in the long run, to adversely affect commercial banks, their management, and their image with the public. If the purpose of the Community Reinvestment Act is to eliminate discrimination in lending to all parties, regardless of race, creed, color, religion, sex, age, marital status, or geographical location, then what do the commercial banks and savings and loan associations that attempt to meet such lending objectives have to worry about?It's about time that some bank managements start to become a little more mature in their approach to the public, and at the same time learn to train their staffs to provide information to members of the public without harassment or delay when such information is ""public."" Cooperation is far better than circumvention. In the long run, those who try to hesitate or circumvent will invite additional regulations that will be even more burdensome."
Answers from Federal Regulators To Most Common CRA Questions,The American Banker,"January 18, 1979, Thursday","The agencies stated that the questions and answers developed by agency staffs should not be taken as official interpretations. Their purpose is solely to be helpful to financial institutions and to the public by providing useful background information.An accompanying statement signed by officials of the agencies provided financial institutions with policy guidance on the general manner in which they should address their responsibilities undr CRA. The agency officials said:""In carrying out their responsibilities under CRA, financial institutions should focus on the spirit of the legislation and try to avid narrow, legalistic interpreations of the legislation or the regulations. The agencies believe that the financial institutions, relying on their own resources, are capable of complying with the requiremets of the regulation.""The statement added that while the agencies want to provide helpful information and guidance -- and will issue further --questions and answers in the future --they wish to keep official interpretations of CRA regulations to a minimum.The CRA became effective Nov. 6, 1978. It is intended to encourage federally insured commercial banks, mutual savings banks and savings and loan associations to help meet the credit needs of their entire communities, including low-and moderate-income neighborhoods, while preserving the flexibility needed by financial institutions to operate safely and soundly. dly.With respect to the staff questions and answers, the agencies said: ""Since the final regulations and examination procedures have been made public, a number of questions have been raised about them by financial institutions and individuals. In order to assist financial institutions in meeting their responsibilities under CRA and to increase public understandding . . . the staffs of the agencies have prepared the attached paper which presents that most common questions about the CRA regulation and examination procedures and the staffs' responses . . . ""The questions and answers provide staff guidance as to the meaning the agencies attach to key terms in the act and their implementing regulations, such as ""office,"" ""local community"" and ""small"" busines or farm. They also address such subjects as the contents of the institutionss' CRA statements that must be prepared to comply with CRA regulations, the availability if public comments files, and how institutions should deal with the delineation of lowand moderate-incme neighborhoods in their communities.1. What does the term of "" office mean as used in the regulation?Answer: Office refers generally to a facility of an institution that accepts deposits, including an electronic deposit facility. It does not include purely administrative offices, agencies, loan production offices or facilities used, for example, only for the check collection process. In delineating a local community, however, an institution need not take into account shared eletronic deposit facilities, unless otherwise directed by the appropriate agency.2. What is meant by ""local community"" and how detailed a map should be used to portray it?Answer: The term ""local community"" used in the regulation refers to the contiguous area surrounding each office or group of offics of an institution. While it is recognized that the geographic areas served by an institution may vary with the type of service, only one local community is to be delineated for a particular office or group of offices. Any map which depicts an institution's local community or communities with reasonable clarity may be used. It need not, for example, be a detailed map showing each street in the community, nor need it be professionally prepared by a cartographer. Low-and moderate-income neighborhoods should not be specifically indicated on the map. The community delineation, however, must not unreasonably exclude such neighborhoods. An institution having several local communities may delineate all of them on one map. It is important, however, that each local community comprising the entire community be delineated with sufficient clarity so that it can be readily determined which areas are being included in those local communities. If the entire community is made up of more than a few local communities or the local communities are separated by significant distances, it may be easier and clearer to use a separate map for each local community. Furthermore, there is no requirement that the locations of the institution' offices be shown on the maps.3. How should an institution deal with low - and moderate-income neighborhoods not be unreasonably excluded from a delineation of the local community. As the preamble to the regulation states, ""Institutions are expected to be generally aware of low- and moderate-income neighborhoods within their community, without undertaking extensive research."" No attempt need be made to distinguish between low-income neighborhoods and moderate-income neighborhoods. If institutions desire further information about low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, they shoudl consult such sources as: the guidance given examiners or page 12 of the agencies' in Nov. 22, 1978; and state and local community development and planning agencies.4. What should be included in a CRA statement?Answer: At a minimum, an institution's CRA statement must include for each local community:a. A map delineating that local community.b. A list of the types of credit it is prepared to extend in that community.c. A copy of the Community Reinvestment ACt Notice provided for in the regulation.Also, an institution's board of directors must, at least annually, review each CRA statement, and act on any material changes in a statement at the board's first regular meeting after a change.In addition, each institution is encouraged, but not required in its statement to:a. Describe how its current efforts help meet community credit needs.b. Report on its record of helping to meet community credit needs.c. Describe its efforts to ascertain community credit needs, including communication with community members on this subject.5. How specific a list of the type of credit offered in a local community is needed for the CRA statement?Answer: Each type of credit the institution is prepared to extend in its local community should be listed. The regulation indicates that greater specificity is desired with respect to residential mortgage and housing rehabilitation loans and loans to small business and farms. In these general categories, subcategories, such as ""residential loanf for one-to-four dwelling units,"" ""residential loans for five dwelling units and over,"" should be used.6. If an institution is prepared to offer particularly types of credit only at some of its offices in a local community, should those types of credit be listed on the CRA statements of all of its offices in that community?Answer: Yes. Because the institution is willing to extend that type of credit to any credit-worthy borrower in the community, the institution should be list the types of credit on the CRA statement of each office even though a prospective borrower at one office may be referred to another when seeking to make application. The institution should bear in mind, however, that public complaints may arise because of such practices; and the agencies will have to make a judgment as to whether the practice significantly discourages applications for such credit or otherwise adversely affects the institution's CRA performance.7. What is a ""small"" business or farm?Answer: For CRA purposes, the term ""small"" refers to the absolute size of the business and farm rather than the relative size in their industries. Because a major concern of CRA is that all creditworthy borrowers have reasonable access to loans from banks and savings and lons, small businesses and farms generally are viewed as those which do not have access to regional and national credit markets. Put another way, small business and farms are those that must rely on their local lending institutions for credit.8. How should past CRA statements, current CRA statements and public comment files be made available to the public in each office of an institution, particularly an isntitution that has offices in more than one local community?Answer: An institution that has offices in more than one local community should maintain current CRA statements for all its local communities at its head office and current CRA statements for each local community in each office of the institution in that local community, except offpremises electronic deposit facilities.Any CRA statements that were in effect during the past two years should be retained with the public comment letters in the public comment file. A comment file for the entire institution must be maintained at the head office, and a comment file pertaining to a particular local community must be retained at a designated office in that community.9. Are all signed, written CRA comment letters to be placed in the public comment file?Answer: The regulations say that the institution must be put all signed, written comments relating to the CRA statement or to the institution's performance in helping meet the community credit needs into a public file. The only exception to this is comments which reflect adversely on the reputatin of any person, or which would violate a law. The institution must use its own judgment, both as to what letters relate to its performance in meeting community credit needs, and as to what comments might reflect adversely on a person's reputation. Signed, written comments which are excluded from the public file because they might harm a perso's reputation should be retained in a non-public file for inspection by the examiner.10. IF a letter is addressed in part to an institution's overall CRA performance, but contains some information which is harmful to an individual or violates a law, should the institution withhold the entire letter from the public file?Answer: The institution may do so. Alternatively the statement(s) which reflect adversely on an individual or violate a law may be deleted from a copy of the letter and the balance of the letter included in the public file. In any event, the entire original letter shoudl be retained for inspection by the examiner.11. Under what circumstances will comments about an institution's CRA statement(s) or performance in helping to meet community credit needs and/or the institution's response(s) be made public?Answer: Any signed, written comment received by a financial institution that is placed in the public comment file will be available for any interested person and the CRA examiner to inspect. Comments received by a supervisory agency will be available for any interested person and the CRA examiner to inspect. Coments received by a supervisory agency will be on file at the agency. These comments are available to members of the public and the financial institutions unless exempted from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act.12. Is the institution obligated to respond to any or all comments received from the public?Answer: There is no requirement that the institution respond. However, the financial institution may find it helpful to respond to certain comments in order to foster a dialogue with members of the community or to present relevant information to the regulatory Agency. If an institution responds to a letter in the public file, the response must also be placed in the public file unless it reflects adversely on any person or violates a law.13. Are there any requirements relating to the size and placement of the Community Reinvestment Act notice?Answer: The notice must be placed in the public lobby of the financial institution but there are no specific requirements relating to size and placement. The agencies believe the rule of reason must apply depending on the form of the notice.For example, if the notice is provided in the form of a poster, the poster must be place within the lobby where it will likely be seen by customers and be of sufficient size to be easily read from the distance at which it will normally be viewed. If the notice is provided in the form of a flyer, a supply of such flyers printed in easily-read type and place where they will likely be notice will surface. The notice requirement may also be satisfied by making the CRA statement, which includes the notice available as a brochure in the lobby placed where it will be noticed.14. What information and avenues of communication are available to members of a community who are concerned about the performance of financial institutions in their community?Answer: Financial institutions are being encouraged to communicate with members of their community. The CRA regulation requires financial institutions to make availabe to the public their ""CRA statement."" The statement contains a map showint the boundaries of the local community delineated by the institution and lists the type of credit that the institution is prepared to extend to members of the community. The statement also contains a copy of the ""Public Notice"" that all financial institutions must have in their offices. The public notice states that members of the public may write to the financial institution or the appropriate regulatory authority concerning the institution's performance in helping to meet community credit needs. Members of the community may also review letters from the public receive by a financial institution regarding such perfomance.Announcements of CRA-convered applications may be obtained by writing to an institution's supervisory agency. Anyone may comment on the filing of an application covered by the CRA by writing to an institution's supervisory agency. Anyone may comment on the filing of an application covered by CRA by writing to the appropriate supervisory agency listed either in the applicant's newspaper notice or its CRA notice. The agencies have varying comment periods for applications. Therefor, any questions regarding the comment period should be directed to the regional office of the appropriate agency. Comments received within the appropriate period will be considered by the AGency in the applications process.15. Will an institution bereqired to document that it is actually extending the types of credit that is listed in its CRA Statement as being offered in the local community?The CRA regulations do not require any documentation beyond the public comment files. Examiners will, however, review information required to be maintained under any applicable fair housing regulations, loan registers if required by the agency, and the application files required to be kept under the Federal Reserve Equal Credit Opportunity regulation and housing loan statements prepared under the Home Mortgage Disclosure regulation. Examiners will also use other available materials (such as advertising copy) to determine if the instution is offering in good faith to extend the types of credit that is has listed on its CRA statement."
FHLBB Approves S&L Branch Protested Under CRA; Lending Pact Set,The American Banker,"March 22, 1979, Thursday","The application originally was opposed by four community organizations, including the Missouri Coalition for Housing. They withdrew their objection last October after the signing of an agreement with Community Federal that promises availability of funds for residential mortgage, rehabilitation and home improvement loans.Three other applications protested under CRA are pending at the FHLBB. In its first decision involving a CRA issue, the FHLBB in December approved an application by City Investing Co. of New York to merge its subsidiary, the Southern California Savings and Loan Association, Beverly Hills, into Surety Savings and Loan Association, Burbank.The name of the surviving S&L became the $316.2 million-deposit Southern California Savings and Loan Association, Beverly Hills.The two FHLBB members, Robert H. McKinney and Anita Miller, both voted in favor of the Community Federal application. However, Mrs. Miller suggested that the specific dollars and percentages of lending Community Federal promised in the agreement tended towards a type of credit allocation. The board wants to encourage agreements between community groups and S&Ls but not those that represent credit allocation, she said.In the agreement, Community Federal said that in evaluating a loan application, it will not give any consideration to the location or age of the property -- providing that the estimated economic life of the property is commensurate with the term of the loan requested.At the Wednesday meeting, FHLBB officials questioned the previous phrase starting with the word providing and suggested it might not be consistent with a section of the FHLBB's anti-discrimination regulations.They were referring to a section which states that loan decisions should be based on the present market value of the property offered as security -- including consideration of specific improvements to be made by the borrower -- and the likelihood that the property will retain an adequate value during the term of the loan.The agreement was signed early in October by two Community Federal officials, Kenneth Fiala, executive vice president, and Emmett A. Capstick, senior vice president, as well as by Jerome D. Riffel, a lawyer who represented the four groups and who is affiliated with Legal Aid of Western Missouri in St. Louis.The agreement was reached the night before a FHLBB hearing held in Des Moines about the protested application and was read into the record by Mr. Riffel as the hearing began, Galen Beaufort, attorney with the St. Louis legal aid group, said this week.The agreement, which contained a withdrawal of the four groups' objection to the application, said that Community Federal agreed to originate single-family residential mortgages in purchases or resales totaling $500,000 a year. Community Federal also agreed to consistently maintain an availability of $100,000 for rehabilitation and home improvement loans. Both promises were subject to loan demand and applied to a specified primary market area in Kansas City.In addition, the S&L said that it would ""assign a high priority"" to making loans to qualified borrowers in the primary market area and that"" at all times it shall maintain a rough ratio, again depending upon loan demand, of 10% of savings deposited in this branch"" for single-family mortgage, rehabilitation and home improvement loans.Further, Community Federal agreed to make an annual contribution of $10,000 to the Neighborhood Housing Services of Kansas City ""so long as that organization remains viable."" It agreed to assign a senior employee of the new branch the function of promoting affirmative urban lending in full cooperation with that NHS unit.Community Federal agreed that the four neighborhood groups may establish a community council, with a maximum of six persons, to meet quarterly with the manager of the Kansas City branch in order to insure the S&L's compliance with the agreement. Community Federal also described its current lending policy.The FHLBB decision in the Southern California S&L case said that City Investing Co. and Southern California S&L shall stipulate, in the form of resolutions of both boards, that Southern California S&L will submit an affirmative lending and marketing program acceptable to the supervisory agent by Feb. 5, 1979. It also stipulated that Southern California S&L shall adopt and submit by Feb. 5 a CRA statement acceptable to the supervisory agent."
Reinvestment Panel Slated by ABA,The American Banker,"January 24, 1979, Wednesday","""In light of the Community Reinvestment Act, which focuses on the role of banks in meeting local community credit needs, the workshop will be structured to give bankers an insight into urban reinvestment techniques, including those for low - and moderate-income neighborhoods,"" Mr. Perkins said. He is also president of the Continental Illinois National Bank & Trust Co., of Chicago.He said a special ABA group -- the 1979 urban development workshop committee -- has been appointed to plan the meeting. James L. Hetland Jr., senior vice president, urban development department, First National Bank of Minneapolis, was appointed to head the committee.The workshop will use the Community Reinvestment Act as a starting point in a program which will demonstrate innovative techniques for leveraging private resources for community development. The Comptroller of the Currency, John G. Heimann, has been invited to address the participants on the regulators' expectations of bank performance under the act.Included in the workshop will be ""how-to"" sessions focusing on specific case studies such as the NCNB Community Development Corp., Charlotte, recently approved by the Comptroller of the Currency for North Carolina. The corporation was formed by the North Carolina National Bank for investment in urban rehabilitation.Special emphasis also will be given to Federal and state programs which can support or add to community development projects, as well as other new financing sources and mechanisms.The workshop will be held in the Sheraton St. Louis Hotel, which is a major element of a 16-block Convention Plaza downtown rehabilitation project now in progress.Serving with Mr. Hetland on the committee are Ralph Calabrese, assistant vice president, Economic Development Center, Citibank NA, New York; Linda Frankel, executive director, Council for Northeast Economic Action, Boston; Joseph Martin, member, board of directors, NCNB Community Development Corp., and John J. Wuest, vice president, Mercantile Trust Co., NA, St. Louis.Information on registering for the workshop is available from Janice A. Booker, assistant director, urban development, ABA, 1120 Connecticut Ave., N.W., Washington 20036; (202) 467-4173."
Local Reviews OF CRA Urged,The American Banker,"January 26, 1979, Friday","Comptroller of the Currency John G. Heimann and Federal Home Loan Bank Board chairman Robert H. McKinney said local officials could assist examiners and regulators in assessing the performance of lenders by reviewing the CRA statements which banks and thrift institutions must make publicly available for the first time Feb. 5.Their comments were made at the midwinter committee meeting of the United States Conference of Mayors.The Community Reinvestment Act requires each institution to draft a statement which defines its lending community and the type of credit available to customers.Public comments on those statements must be kept on file at banks and savings and loan associations, according to CRA. These comments must be taken into consideration by the regulatory agencies when institutions apply to expand their operations.Several mayors attending the meeting told the regulators they had difficult times recruiting local lenders to participate in community development efforts.""The chances are,"" Mr. Heimann said,"" probably 90% of the financial institutions in this country have a sense of obligation to their community.""However, he said officials of financial institutions often have inaccurate concepts of the credit needs of their communities, and the CRA offers the opportunity for local officials to correct this.He said such comments would benefit bank examiners who travel extensively and are less capable of evaluating the community credit needs of each area.""You've got to raise the issue,"" Mr. Heimann told the mayors.Mr. Heimann said he would make available to interested mayors copies of manuals which give details of methods used by examiners to evaluate an institution's definition of community credit needs.Both Mr. Heimann and Mr. McKinney invited the mayors to work directly with the regulatory agencies on community reinvestment projects in their areas."
"SC Natl. Bank, Seeking Guidance On CRA, Finds 'Needs' Are Few",The American Banker,"November 26, 1979, Monday","But what South Carolina National Bank found was a scattershot of attitudes, no dominant trends, and few needs expressed that could be addressed by banks, except for several requests for credit-counseling.The $1 billion-deposit SCNB, the state's largest bank, recently completed its survey of civic and political leaders in 23 communities across the state to find out whether the bank is meeting their needs and found that ""needs"" expressed in those communities often were not financial.""In one community, for example,"" said Virginia Grose, who was responsible for the survey, ""a lot of people were concerned about consolidation of city and country government.""If I were running for office in that community, I'd run on that issue,"" she said.Nevertheless, the survey produced some specific information providing avenues for SCNB officers to pursue, assured management that they were thoroughly trying to communicate with a diverse public, and reassured employees that their role in the community is recognized.The survey is conducted in conjunction with requirements of the Community Reinvestment Act.It was the subject of a speech delivered by Edward J. Hamilton Jr., assistant general counsel for the bank, at a Payments Systems, Inc., conference in Boca Raton, Fla., in October.Mr. Hamilton pointed to SCNB's ""very diverse customer and market base. Its income sources include the textile industry, military installations, educational institutions, agriculture, tourism and light manufacturing.""The customers we serve range from the very well educated to those with little education, and from the very poor to the very wealthy,"" he said.In order to determine the views of a wide spectrum of people and to fulfill an elaborate design in terms of compliance with consumer legislation, the bank sent a seven-question form to approximately 1,400 individuals.Under the name of the local city executive, the forms went to people from chambers of commerce, public-housing councils, Urban League chapters, League of Women Voters chapters, government agencies and local development corporations, among others.Between 500 and 600 questionnaires were completed and returned, according to Mrs. Grose.Respondents were questioned on whether they were familiar with SCNB and with SCNB employees' roles in community affairs.In addition, the survey included open-ended questions on whether all banks in the community offer a satisfactory range of financial services.Describing the questionnaire, Mr. Hamilton said, ""It was an attempt to not just to wait until someone comes in with a complaint, but to go out and find out what the needs are.""The needs, according to respondents, are rarely things banks can influence.Credit counseling was one need expressed, Mrs. Grose said, and the city executives in the areas where that need was expressed are following up to provide counseling materials and resources.Another need expressed was for more mortgage money, she said.She said, however, that mortgage credit is an area determined by current economic conditions, not bank policy.""There was a great diversity of needs expressed,"" she continued. ""I'd say that not even 5% of the individuals identified the same financial needs.""No changes in the marketing and community relations areas are planned as a result of the survey.""I did not find anything statistically valid enough to recommend that we change course,"" she said.One result of the survey, she said, was that community leaders noted that they recognize SCNB employees as active in community affairs.""We think we're active in community affairs,"" Mrs. Grose said, ""but what do people in the communities think? Do they perceive us as active as we see ourselves? That answer, apparently, is 'yes', which is interesting, and it's good that they do.""The bank's newsletter informed employees of the survey results.Generally, Mr. Hamilton said, the effect of the survey was to open lines of communication that had either not existed or were not as strong as before the questionnaire was issued. It probed community attitudes before they reach ""the complaint stage,"" he said."
Official Notes CRA's Key Sentence,The American Banker,"January 30, 1979, Tuesday","Speaking at a meeting sponsored by the Bank Administration Institute, the coordinator, Jeffrey A. Tisdale, directed attention to the following sentence of the FDIC regulations implementing CRA: ""Lenders are encouraged to include also in their CRA statement a statement of how they are helping to meet community credit needs, a periodic report on how they are attempting to ascertain the credit needs of their local communities.""Mr. Tisdale told the bankers, ""The most important thing is finding out the credit needs of the community and making loans, not gerrymandering out low- and moderate-income neighborhoods.""Paul M. Metzger, assistant to the staff director for management of the Federal Reserve Board, said that the theory behind the encouragement approach is that the needs of the community are more likely to be met when members of the community know what credit is available and banks know what credit is needed.Mr. Tisdale noted that the regulations covering CRA might be entitled ""groping in the dard.""Emphasis of CRA is on low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, Mr. Tisdale said. Financial institutions, in drawing up their CRA statements, may not draw up different territories for different types of loans, he suggested. CRA does not tell bankers what kinds of loans they must make, but the loans it does make must be available to every creditworthy customer, Mr. Tisdale said.He said that the Federal regulatory agencies ""want self-regulation"" by financial institutions which CRA applies to.Under CRA, lenders are required to prepare a map delineating their local community or communities, which they may determine by using the boundary of a standard metropolitan statistical area, defining their effective lending territory, or by using any other reasonable means which does not exclude low- and moderate-income areas.The boards of institutions subject to the act are required to adopt a CRA statement by Feb. 4. This statement must include a delineation of local community, a list of principal types of credit the lender is prepared to extend in that community, and a copy of the CRA notice."
A CRA Pitfall,The American Banker,"January 22, 1979, Monday","It is a reaffirmation of the principle that any good banker has accepted at the beginning of his career that if the bank does not serve its community, then both the community and the bank suffer adversely from this neglect.This is what makes some bankers so unhappy with the CRA provisions Government now intervenes even more in bank operations and requires additional sets of reports to make sure the bank is doing what it is supposed to do in the first place.But closer scrutiny reveals it is not so simple an issue. Some feel that diligent following of the CRA requirements can bring negative impact to the nation and to the communities that depend on bank funds for renewal and growth.For the assumption is built into the CRA principle that the areas where people have savings are also the areas where people need to borrow. But this is a premise that does not stand up under examination.Naturally the first thought in applying CRA principles is of lending to depressed areas of a community and making sure that poorer minority borrowers and decaying areas are not denied credit.Yet the assumption of the CRA is that these areas are generating money that is now being siphoned off to lend to more affluent areas and groups in the bank's territory.The truth is usually quite the opposite: the areas that need bank funds badly are usually not the areas where banks are generating savings. To require that the bank stick to the narrow concept of lending where it obtains its funds would thus bring exactly the opposite result from the one desired of aiding the sectors in need of money.The same analysis applies to the granting of credit in newly developing areas. For new towns and rapidly growing regions are usually capital-short areas whose credit needs vastly exceed funds available.The real issue then is what is a community? Is a community a small tract of real estate surrounding one bank office or one bank branch? Or is it the entire geographical area the bank serves?One can even go further and question the wisdom of making the legal concept of a community smaller than the entire nation. For one of the great strengths of this country has been the ability of banks, savings institutions, mortgage bankers, and the entire financial community to gather funds from capital-surplus areas and channel them to capital-short regions.The beneficiaries of this have been in both sectors.Financial institutions in the older Northeast, for example, would have had a difficult time meeting the interest payments necessary to keep savings and time deposits on board were it not for an ability to place excess funds into mortgage loans and pass-through securities that financed housing in more rapidly growing sectors such as the Sunbelt. To consider the Northeast as a community and to question the flow of funds elsewhere certainly could hurt these regions and their savers just as much as it would hurt the regions needing the capital.This does not mean that banks should neglect the home community. And certainly we recognize what Congress was trying to achieve through the Community Reinvestment Act in making sure that banks do not neglect the home community in their effort to direct funds where returns and opportunities appear to be greater.But bankers still worry about too narrow an interpretation of the CRA principles which would almost tie down a bank's lending to the availability of savings and demand-deposit funds in a specific small sector of the trading area.For the result here would be that to the rich would be given, since banks would lend where the fund sources are, while those communities that need funds badly would be denied them because they ironically did not generate the deposits.Too narrow an interpretation would lead to the very neglect of the communities that the Community Reinvestment Act was intended to serve. And this undoubtedly would lead in turn to new remedial legislation that would involve even more government interference into the process of taking deposits and making loans.The regulators, which have been left a very wide latitude indeed in interpreting CRA, have a heavy responsibility to make sure that narrow interpretations do not evolve during the examination process."
Mo. Will Train CDCU Directors,The American Banker,"October 2, 1979, Tuesday","In the past 18 months, five community development credit unions have opened in Missouri and board members of the new CDCUs have received special training designed to help them set up financial institutions capable of meeting the particular needs of people in depressed areas. CDCUs are ""neighborhood"" credit unions designed to keep members' savings working in their communities.""The five (CDCUs) in Missouri are unique because of the special training their board members have been given,"" said Tony Barnicle, director of the Missouri Division of Community Development.The community development division obtained a Federal grant from the Office of Minority Business Enterprise that was used to hire a neighborhood development consulting firm which provided training and technical assistance to new board members.The Washington-based consulting company, called Alternative Economics, set up the program that is supported by several Missouri Department of Consumer Affairs agencies, including the state Division of Credit Unions and the Division of Community Development.Mr. Barnicle said the training also is designed to qualify these credit unions to receive special seed money that can be used to increase the amount of loans a CU can make to its members.To qualify for these Federal funds, a CDCU must be certified eligible by the National Credit Union Administration and the Community Service Administration. Although any CDCU can become eligible for the funds, the Missouri CDCUs will have an advantage because of their board members' training, Mr. Barnicle said.Another facet of the OMBEfunded training has been directed toward key personnel in the Divisions of Credit Unions and Community Development and other community leaders. Their training will allow them, in turn, to provide the technical assistance the consulting firm had been giving.""Now, if a community wants to establish a CDCU, or if an existing credit union wants to modify its charter to become a CDCU, we'll be able to give them the help they need,"" said John Lewis, director of the state Division of Credit Unions.The newest Missouri CDCU, First Citizens Credit Union, opened last month in St. Louis. The state's other four CDCUs are in ST. Louise (1), Kansas City, (2) and Cabool (1).According to Mr. Lewis, the Missouri CDCUs ""offer a real possibility to turn things around in the economically depressed neighborhoods in which they're located.""And Mr. Barnicle, who was instrumental in developing the concept of CDCUs when he was with the National Center for Urban Ethnic Affairs in Washington, said that the ""reaction we've had from the members of our CDCUs. . . shows that this program is going to work in Missouri."""
Mass. 'CRA' Bill Is Near Enactment,The American Banker,"May 16, 1979, Wednesday","""This sets out what a bank's obligations to the community are and provides a mechanism to see those services are met,"" explained Sen. John Brennan, D., Malden, chairman of the committee on banks and banking.The bill is a redraft of several others modeled after the Federal Community Reinvestment Act which ""encourages"" financial institutions to meet the credit needs of the communities in which they are chartered.That Federal act was implemented last year but applies only to 22 Federally chartered banks in Massachusetts, according to Sen. Brennan. The state version, he added, would extend the same obligations on reporting credit services and geographical areas in which they are available to all banks in the state.One of the original bills was cosponsored by the House banking committee chairman, Rep. Antone S. Aguiar, D., Swansea, leading Sen. Brennan to expect the composite version would easily receive final legislative approval.The Senate Monday made only one amendment, removing a sunset provision that would have required renewal of the bill in five years.The Community reinvestment Act, as the state measure is called, ""is an attempt to get some accountability out of banks in their investment areas and extend the Federal act to banks which are state-chartered,"" said Andy Warren, an aide to Sen. Joseph Timilty, D., Boston, who originally filed one of the bills.Banks would be required to prepare, at least annually, a statement of which communities they cover, without excluding low and moderate income neighborhoods or contiguous areas.The statement would have to include the delineation of the local community and a list of specific types of credit within certain categories, such as residential loans for single and multiple-family housing, housing rehabilitation loans, home improvement, small business, farm, community development commercial and consumer loans the bank is prepared to offer.Optional reporting statements would include:A description of how the bank's efforts, including special credit related programs, help meet community credit needs.A periodic report proving how those needs have been met.A description of efforts to ascertain credit needs of the community.Sen. Brennan said the bill would prod banks into offering a wide range of services or face written documentation of opposition from individuals and community groups dissatisfied with those efforts.If the banking commissioner finds the credit and social needs of a community relating to banking have not been met, he can deny approval of branches or mergers.The commissioner would be authorized to consider bank efforts to advertise services, marketing and special credit programs, geographic distribution of bank services and credit denials, evidence of discrimination, participation in development projects, record of opening and closing offices, origination of mortgage loans, and practices intended to discourage credit applications.Sen. Brennan said he hopes banks would also begin programs like homebuying clinics and credit seminars."
Fed Narrowly Approves New Mo. BHC,The American Banker,"July 5, 1979, Thursday","Governors Philip E. Coldwell and Nancy H. Teeters voted against allowing the firm to become a bank holding company.The Board decision came despite the fact that Community Bank is owned by relatives of James F. Dierberg, who controls ""directly or indirectly"" 72% of the stock of the $210 million-asset First Missouri Banks, also of Creve Coeur.A subsidiary of First Missouri Banks, the $19.8 million-deposit First Missouri Bank of Gasconade County, Hermann, serves the same market as Community Bank, according to the text of the decision. Together, the two banks control 51.8% of the market's commercial bank deposits. Mr. Dierberg disputes the assertion that the two banks, which are located about 15 miles apart, serve the same market. ""They really are two different banking markets, and all the printed information shows that,"" he said in a telephone interview.Mr. Dierberg's relatives gained control of Community Bank in 1974, when such an acquisition was still not subject to Board approval. A 1978 change in the Bank Control Act requires 60 days advance notice of any acquisition of an insured bank, which can then be disapproved by the regulatory authorities if certain criteria are not met.Robert C. Kirchhofer, president of the Gasconade County bank, also serves as chairman of Community Bank. Thomas Walkenbach is both associate vice president of the Gasconade County Bank and president of Community Bank.In their decision, chairman G. William Miller and governors Henry C. Wallich and J. Charles Partee concluded that since its 1974 acquisition, Community bank ""has become a meaningful alternative in the relevant banking market.""They refer to an increase in the bank's loan-to-deposit ratio from 22% to 60% and a doubling of total deposits. The bank has increased considerably the scope of its services to its customers by offering passbook savings accounts, a full range of certificates of deposit, service charge-free checking, and consumer and instalment loans. Community Bank also improved its facility and made a five-fold increase in the maximum limit of loans that it offers, according to the decision.In a dissenting statement attached to the Board's decision, governors Coldwell and Teeters wrote that ""the acquisition would perpetuate a substantially adverse competitive situation within the relevant banking market that is not outweighed by convenience and needs considerations.""The two governors also objected to the manner in which Mr. Dierberg's family gained control of Community Bank five years ago, stating that ""to tolerate such maneuverings serves to undermine the basic policy of the Bank Holding Act.""Approval of the action, the dissenting opinion went on, strengthens the common ownership of the two banks and lessens the likelihood that they would in the future ""become independent and competing organizations.""The dissenting governors also asserted that no new public benefits will be instituted as a result of Board approval. The Board's ""reliance"" on existing services of the bank ""is misplaced,"" they concluded.Mr. Dierberg said that converting to the holding company form of ownership will benefit the bank's customers. ""This allows the bank to pay off its debt and yet retain capital,"" he pointed out.As a result of the greater capital position, Mr. Dierberg said, the bank will be able to increase its legal loan limit.Community Bank's legal loan limit is now less than $100,000, according to Mr. dierberg, which, he said, is not enough to do business with a farmer in an era when a single combine can cost more than that amount."
"CRA Conditions Set for Two S&L Branches; Texas Bank Allowed to Leave Minority Site;
Replacement Set",The American Banker,"June 22, 1979, Friday","The $78.6 million-deposit Kelly Field National Bank of San Antonio received the approval about two weeks ago on its application to relocate to Leon Valley, Tex., and on its application to charter the new Exchange National Bank.The Comptroller's office had denied Kelly Field's relocation application in 1977.Meanwhile, the $8 billion-deposit Home Federal Savings & Loan Association of San Diego and groups protesting its branch application have reached an agreement and the protest has been withdrawn, according to lawyers for both sides. The protesters had alleged that the S&L's financing of unscrupulous home- improvement contractors which obtained liens on homes of low-income Los Angeles residents was exploiting credit needs of those residents.The protest in the Kelly Field case is unusual is that it came not from community groups but from five banks, alleging Kelly Field had not served its community in the past. Reflecting the care of the Comptroller's office in deciding this case, the applications were filed Feb. 1, 1978, a hearing was held in Dallas on Dec. 12 and they were approved June 4, 1979.The Comptroller's approval is unconditional except that it provides that Kelly Field will not relocate until the new bank is prepared to open. The Comptroller's office, in a June 4 letter to Kelly Field president Harry A. Hixon, calls the application to charter a new bank, along with its relocation bid, ""a creative and positive response to the CRA.""Mr. Hixon said in an interview that Exchange National will not only provide the services now provided by Kelly Field but also will provide additional services, such as home improvement and mortgage loans. The bank will be community- oriented, he emphasized.Mr. Hixon explained that about 75% of Kelly Field's depositors are military personnel, most of whom live on bases outside Texas. Mr. Hixon and a Comptroller's office official in Washington said that in Leon Valley, Kelly Field would have a much more accessible and convenient location for retail banking, could better serve resident military personnel who had moved to the suburbs, and could obtain a needed expansion of physical facilities. A highway loop built since the bank opened in 1956 left the bank in a poor geographic position, Mr. Hixon added.Mr. Hixon explained that the capital for the new bank -- totaling $1.6 million -- will come from about 25 business and professional persons, mostly of Mexican-American origin, who live in the community or who conduct business there.Mr. Hixon said that at this time only one of the five directors of the new Exchange National Bank will be from the group of Mexican-American investors. That will be Alfonso Garza, a local accountant active in the planning for the new bank.According to Kelly Field's applications, Exchange's board ultimately will consist of three representatives of the new investor group and two directors from Kelly Field Bancorp. and Kelly Field National Bank. The bank did not specify, and the Comptroller did not require, a date when this would be accomplished.The applications mention that two representatives of the investor group will be among 11 on the board of the holding company and relocated bank.The three representatives would not hold a majority of stock in Exchange, the Comptroller's office official disclosed. Kelly Field Bancorp., under the planned arrangement, will own all of the stock in Exchange, except for qualifying shares of Exchange directors.Mr. Hixon said that the investor group would receive the common stock of Kelly Field Bancorp. and that the $1.6 million would be used specifically to capitalize the new bank. The new bank's president and chief executive officer will be James Edward Ortiz, 39, currently vice president and cashier at Kelly Field, and a Mexican-American.Both Mr. Hixon and the Comptroller's office official pointed out that Exchange will have access to the managerial resources of Kelly Field and of its holding company, and will be provided ready-to-use facilities (the two banks will have separate staffs).Mr. Hixon noted that in Texas, where branch banking is illegal, the only way to expand is to form a bank holding company and charter a de novo bank.Mr. Hixon noted Exchange will be a community, not a minority, bank and will not be ""championing"" socio-economic service to the community.In its June 4 letter, the Comptroller's office expressed reservations about the proposed community deliniation for Exchange, given Kelly Field's ""expressed commitment to serve all minority and low-and moderate-income groups in San Antonio."" The Comptroller's office official interviewed said it simply was not ""symmetrical"" and may need revision.The Comptroller's letter also noted that the CRA statements of Kelly Field and of Exchange did not list residential loans though the bank said at the public hearing it had a substantial commitment to such loans. Mr. Hixon said that was an oversight and the Comptroller's office official tended to agree with him.Kelly Field currently is located in a predominantly low-and moderate-income Mexican-American community. Mr. Hixon estimated that more than 100,000 Mexican Americans live in the community, as defined on Kelly Field's CRA statement.Carmen Badillo, president of San Antonio Community Organizing for Public Service, a grassroots organization which has campaigned for capital improvements, said the group was hopeful Exchange would do a good job of meeting community credit needs. She said under Mr. Hixon, who became president about four years ago, the bank had become more oriented to the community.Ms. Badillo said Mr. Ortiz had shown both his willingness to work with the community and his interest in aiding its economic development. However, she noted he does not live in the community of Exchange. She also said she was concerned that reduced taxes would be collected from Exchange for the local Edgewood School District, which she said is among the poorest in the region.No community group was involved in the planning of the new bank.Michael Garcia, acting community development director of the Mexican- American Unity Council, a community development corporation, noted that the largest S&L in San Antonio is moving from downtown to a new development area, and that four S&Ls moved their main offices from downtown before CRA became effective. He said he had no objection to Kelly Field's plans since a bank was remaining there.Mr. Hixon said he hoped Exchange would open within six months. A pre- opening exam will be held by the Comptroller's office, as is normal before any new bank opens."
"CRA Is Here to Stay, Bankers Told",The American Banker,"November 14, 1979, Wednesday","That was the general sentiment expressed by speakers addressing the annual fall conference of the Savings Banks Marketing Forum of New York State here.But some bankers said positive steps to meet the act's provisions make compliance less onerous.For example, Paul J. Nidasio, assistant vice president and compliance officer for the $846 million-deposit Western New York Savings Bank, Buffalo, said his institution has held seminars and meetings with community groups to assess comminity credit needs. When other groups lodged a CRA protest after the bank applied for an electronic branch, the bank got approval with the aid of positive comments from groups with which the savings bank had been working.G. Thomas Bowers, vice president and marketing officer for the $438 million-deposit Monroe Savings Bank, Rochester, said the savings bank developed, as a result of community group seminars, a combination mortgage, hoem improvement loan. Only home improvements needed to make a dilapidated house livable, such as wiring and plumbing, are eligible to be mortgaged under the program.Mr. Bowers said this program should help the bank's CRA standing in the event of community group protests.Richard J. Santoro, senior vice president of the $4.1 billion-deposit Dime Savings Bank of New York, said the savings bank invests in expensive computer time to have current, centralized information details on loan applications.The New York State Banking Department told Dime that the bank was ""expected"" to provide this information every 60 days when the NYSBD approved Dime's merger with Mechanics Exchange Savings Bank, Albany. Dime had to convince the NYSBD that the low frequency of loans made to a depressed Brooklyn area was due to low demand.The reports were not a condition of the merger, but Dime is anticipating other mortgage activity.Cynthia Lewis, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. regional adviser for community affairs, said that besides providing comprehensive, centralized loan statistics banks should reasonably define their community and its specific credit needs. Banks must also undertake to make people of all income levels aware of their credit services.Banks must avoid gerrymandering their service communities and must have officers clearly responsible to implement CRA initiatives, Mrs. Lewis said. Banks should set up some type of administrative body whose sole purpose is to fill community credit needs, she said.Gary Brody, NYSBD director of community reinvestment monitoring, said regulators understand a shortage of mortgage funds in low-income areas due to general money market conditions. But banks must still show a good-faith effort to implement CRA activities, he said."
Group Is Willing to Withdraw CRA Objection to Ga. S&L Bid,The American Banker,"May 31, 1979, Thursday","The group -- Metro Fair Housing Services, Decatur -- sent DeKalb a letter this month saying that the S&L had demonstrated good faith in meeting unmet credit needs and that Metro was prepared to withdraw its protest. William D. Hosford, president of DeKalb, declined this week to say whether points raised in the letter were correct or otherwise to discuss the case.DeKalb's application was filed at the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta on July 17 and arrived at the Federal Home Loan Bank Board in Washington on Jan. 8, but the FHLBB has not acted on it. A FHLBB official said this week it appeared that the application now would be processed normally and be decided in about a month. He was aware of the May letter.Marti Collier, executive director of Metro, said in an interview this week that Metro objected to the application last July because DeKalb had made very few conventional loans in the southern part of DeKalb County. Southern DeKalb is an integrated community of about 20,000 families, which contains some low-to moderate-income sections as well as affluent suburban areas. DeKalb Federal has two branches in southern DeKalb, Ms. Collier said.The S&L has not made any substantial increase in its lending to that community, she said, but it has taken a number of positive steps, which are recounted in Metro's letter to Mr. Hosford.Ms. Collier said the letter pointed out that DeKalb Federal had contacted real estate agents active in racially integrated neighborhoods to inform them of its willingness to make loans. In addition, DeKalb identified and contacted community groups in southern DeKalb, and helped organize a South DeKalb Community Reinvestment Task Force.The task force, composed of presidents of four S&Ls and representatives of Metro and other community groups, will examine credit needs which have been ignored and help lenders learn more about local neighborhoods, Ms. Collier said.The Metro letter also said that DeKalb had advertised in general circulation newspapers the availability of its CRA statement and its willingness to lend to residents of specified communities, which Ms. Collier said are integrated.In addition, she said, the letter said that DeKalb Federal had begun making government-insured mortgages in South DeKalb. And DeKalb Federal said that an increasing proportion of its assets will be lent for home rehabilitation and purchase rehabilitation loans, Ms. Collier said. She noted that Metro had identified rehabilitation loans as an unmet credit need and said the S&L had shown its willingness to advertise the availability of such loans.The letter also said the S&L had promised to try to respond to other credit needs if an when they are identified by other community groups. It noted, Ms. Collier said, that Mr. Hosford had said that if community groups in the Atlanta-area neighborhoods of Candler-Glenwood and Parkview are able to enumerate specific credit needs in attempting to revitalize local business districts, DeKalb Federal will consider whether it can help meet those needs.Ms. Collier noted the letter received from Mr. Hosford this week cautioned that the S&L would not make speculative loans on business or commercial property and that it is bound by regulations requiring it to make 80% of its loans on single-family residences.Meanwhile, the Metro letter said the community group was ""in no way satisfied"" with DeKalb's record of meeting community needs. The letter added that Metro expected DeKalb to continue making progress in meeting the credit needs of integrated communities in general, and of the southern part of DeKalb County in particular, Ms. Collier said.It declared that Metro will monitor DeKalb's progress in meeting those needs."
Heimann Backs Greater NY Branch,The American Banker,"May 3, 1979, Thursday","The majority decision to deny the application cites the applicant's performance under the convenience and needs factor, particularly with respect to serving the credit needs of the community as specified in the Community Reinvestment Act. Prior to 1977, this applicant pursued a course of action which failed to address the credit needs of its local community. However, as the majority opinion notes, the applicant has more recently undertaken significant actions which began to address these community needs. The central question at issue is whether the applicant's efforts and progress to date have been sufficient to warrant approval of the application. I believe that the applicant's efforts have been sufficient to warrant approval, with the understanding that considerable additional and continuing progress would be expected of this applicant, and that this progress would be the subject of careful evaluation during future examinations and action on future applicatios.The mandate to the financial regulatory agencies under the Community Reinvestment Act is"" . . . to encourage regulated financial institutions to fulfill their continuing and affirmative obligations to help meet the credit needs of their communities . . . "" I believe the agencies should provide this encouragement in a manner which supports genuine and substantial efforts by financial institutions to comply with the objectives of the law. The regulations implementing the Community Reinvestment Act are designed to provide this type of positive encouragement, by specifying that institutions will be evaluated not only on their actual record of lending in the community, but also on the quality of their efforts to establish a dialog with the community and undertake actions to respond to its needs. Applications can and should be favorably treated, even in cases where the institution's lending record may fall short of desired levels, if it is clear that the institution has undertaken significant good-faith efforts to improve its lending performance. It should also be clear that these efforts have begun to demonstrate their effectiveness, and that there is reason to expect continued effort and progress in the future. Obviously, in instances where the institution does not make an effort to fulfill its obligations, or makes only token or temporary efforts, application should be denied.In this case, the Greater New York Savings Bank's actual lending record has not yet reached the point where it constitutes a satisfactory response to the community's credit needs. It is clear, however, that the Greater New York Savings Bank has undertaken very substantial efforts to improve its lending record and to respond to the objectives of the law. These efforts are acknowledged by the majority in its opinion. While the majority of the Board did not conclude that the applicant's improvement was sufficient to warrant approval, the majority did emphasize the extent to which the applicant has begun to respond to local credit needs:""A recent survey conducted by the Corporation indicated that applicant's current lending terms are generally competitive with other savings banks in Brooklyn . . .""A review of the overall record indicates improvement in the bank's lending performance, especially in the area served by its Brooklyn branches. The institution has taken a series of positive steps including advertising, contacts with real estate brokers and meetings with community groups. While the increase in the bank's lending activity is significant, the bank started from a very low level. The improvement that has occurred is encouraging . . . ""In addition to the action cited by the majority, the applicant has implemented a variety of service programs which respond to the positive assessment factors contained in the regulations implementing the Community Reinvestment Act. ""The applicant has significantly altered its mortgage lending terms, and has participated in local community reinvestment activities such as redevelopment and rehabilitation projects. Its campaign to advertise its lending program throughout Brooklyn has led to a substantial increase in mortgage loan applications and a greatly increased volume of mortgage originations. The applicant at this time shows substantial progress, and there is every reason to expect that this progress will continue in the future.""Given these facts, I believe that the application should have been approved, with a clear indication that the institution's commitments would be carefully monitored through the examination process, and that continued improvement would be expected from this institution when the Board considers any applications submitted by it in the future."
ABA Workshop on CRA Slated For April 1 and 2,The American Banker,"March 23, 1979, Friday","JoAnn S.

Mass. Groups Hit Mutual Branch Bid,The American Banker,"November 19, 1979, Monday","The $934.9 million-deposit Provident, which is New England's largest and oldest savings bank, had sought permission and failed under former Commissioner Carol S. Greenwald in 1978.Bank officials said at a recent hearing that they have helped meet some of their community's needs by being involved in civic affairs, such as sponsoring a girls softball team, road races and speeches before college groups.The bank's contention was sharply disputed by the Massachusetts Urban Reinvestment Advisory Board, and Rep. Richard Walsh and Sen. Joseph Timilty, both Democrats.Bank vice president William Maytum outlined Provident efforts to reach out into the community, but opponents cited statistics to prove, they said, the bank had not really me the CRA's intention of requiring financial institutions to satisfy neighborhood credit needs.Mr. Maytum agreed that the civic sponsorship by the bank of community affairs was ""a minor item"" but said it was proof that ""we've been involved in the city."" He added, however, that Provident's involvement with sports activities and local organizations was not the only way in which it had met the intent and spirit of CRA.The primary reason Provident is seeking the branch in Newton, he said, is that it has 8,000 customers in that city with deposits representing $52 million.And throughout Boston, he added, Provident has lent $66 million for purchase of residential properties. Mr. Maytum said the concerns of opponents are ""understandable"" but he felt they were relying too much on the bank's record prior to 1978, the year in which its former branching request was denied.Massachusetts Urban Reinvestment Advisory Board executive director James Carras charged Provident with ""redlining"" whole neighborhoods in Boston, saying the bank has refused to lend mortgage money or approved only a few mortgages in areas that are socially, racially or economically changing.""I haven't used the word 'redlining' in three years,"" Mr. Carras said.But he then told Mr. Mulligan that Provident in 1978 lent mortgage money on only two homes each in East Boston and South Boston, two focal points in recent years of desegregation efforts in the schools by Federal courts.And, Mr. Carras noted, the First American Savings Bank, A $300 million-deposit neighborhood bank based in Dorchester, has lent $10 million in that community in a one-year period from 1978 to 1979, compared to Provident's record of $7.2 million for the entire city, nearly one-third of which went to the affluent areas of Back Bay and Beacon Hill.The community group presented Mr. Mulligan with a three-page list of neighborhoods it contended had been discriminated against by Provident.Opponents said that the CRA was meant to encourage banks to genuinely meet community credit needs and that Provident had no real outreach program, made no marketing efforts to reach low and moderate income families and had no special credit related programs.""Provident was a sitting duc,"" Mr. Carras said, noting the limited presentation made by bank officials. ""They couldn't generate any community support at all.""The bank was opposed also by Mr. Timilty, former chairman of a special Presidential commission on neighborhoods, and Newton Alderman Ethel Sheehan, who said that city did not need the competition from another bank, especially since the prospective site is near other banks.""The Provident lending level in Boston is far behind every other institution,"" Mr. Carras asserted. ""The Provident lending level indicates they are not willing to invest in the community.Mr. Maytum felt that Provident could help anchor the small business community and that the bank's record would stand up to any scrutiny made using the CRA statute. Several persons also spoke in defense of the application, including a Dorchester man who said the bank had granted him $1,000 for a book he is writing about the community.No decision on the application is expected for at least two weeks."
Calif. S&L Plans Urban Loan Office,The American Banker,"August 23, 1979, Thursday","The community groups had alleged that the $2.3 billion-deposit S&L financed home improvements in the predominantly minority south central section of Los Angeles largely through ""lien-sale contracts"" that sometimes involved questionable practices by contractors.The lien-sale contracts in question were said to be open to abuse because they contain a clause allowing a contractor, upon a default by the homeowner, to sell the house at a foreclosure sale without any prior court hearing to satisfy a claim.The coalition filed a protest outlining their charges with the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco against a new branch office planned by Home Federal in La Jolla, a San Diego suburb. The challenge, one of the first under CRA in the western states, was withdrawn after discussions began with the S&L.A spokesman for Home Federal said the loan agency office will be patterned after the loan agency office opened in 1977 by the S&L in southeast San Diego, which he termed the first effort of its kind ""to address the real estate lending needs of the minority community."" The office will offer a full complement of real estate lending services.At the time the protest was filed, a Los Angeles officer of Home Federal said that, while the lien-sale method could be abused by unscrupulous contractors and sales people, the results had been generally good.The agreement with Home Federal, described by a spokesman for the community groups as among the most comprehensive reached with a lending institution since the CRA regulations became effective last February, also calls for the S&L to:Concentrate on direct home improvement lending in south central Los Angeles and put restrictions on lien sale contracts in the area to avoid abuses.Accelerate an already existing affirmative lending program in Los Angeles with special staff and advertising.Commit to the financing of low-income housing purchase and construction, with the help of community organizations in south central Los Angeles.Establish a community advisory board to work with Home Federal on the program's implementation.The community groups involved in the coalition include organizations such as the Center for New Corporate Priorities, the California Public Policy Center, the Greater Watts Justice Center, along with several churches from the area and the adjacent campus of the University of Southern California, as well as a Los Angeles city council member."
Agencies Say CRA Statements Must List All Credit Offered,The American Banker,"January 16, 1979, Tuesday","In a joint statement, the four Federal financial institution supervisors charged with enforcing the law said the type of credit should be listed even though a prospective borrower at one office may be referred to another. By offering the service at one office, the statement said, the financial institution shows willingness to extend it to any creditworthy borrower in the community.The institution should bear in mind, the regulators warned, that public complaints may arise. The Federal agencies will have to judge whether such a policy significantly discourages applications for credit or otherwise adversely affects the lender's CRA record.Covering questions the regulators said they had been asked most frequently about the law, the statement provides staff guidance to defining several terms in the statute and the agencies' implementing regulations.The statement, the regulators said, should not be considered an official interpretation.Additional questions and their answers will be issued by the agencies in the near future, the statement said.Effective last Nov. 6, the CRA requires the agencies to assess the records of financial institutions in meeting the credit needs of their communities, including low-hoods. The agencies must take these assessments into account when considering an application for an institution to expand. Examination procedures for such assessments were issued Nov. 22.""In carrying out their responsibilities under CRA, financial institutions should focus on the spirit of the legislation and try to avoid narrow, legalistic interpretations of the legislation or the regulations,"" the statement issued Monday said.The statement also said that, for the purposes of the regulation, the term ""office"" would not include purely administrative offices, agencies, loan production offices or facilities used only for check collection.In delineating a community, the regulators said, a financial institution need not use a map which shows each street in the area or depicts low-or moderate-income neighborhoods, so long as the neighborhoods are included in the lending map.At a minimum, the statement said, an institution's CRA Statement must include for each local community a map, a list of the types of credit it is prepared to extend in that community and a copy of the CRA Notice required by regulation. The agencies encourage the institutions to also include a description of its current efforts to help meet community credit needs and how it determines them.In the listing of offered credit, the regulation requires greater specificity to residential mortgage, housing rehabilitation and small business and farm loans than with other types of credit, the statement said.Small businesses and farms are those that must rely on their local lending institutions for credit, it added.The statement noted that any public comments filed with a Federal agency on an institution's CRA performance will be available to the public.The CRA regulations do not require any documentation beyond public comment files, the statement observed, but it stress that examiners will review information required to be maintained by other laws and regulations, as well as other types of materials, such as advertising copy.The statement was issued by the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Home Loan Bank Board."
Bank Regulator in W. Va. Moved to Development Post,The American Banker,"March 20, 1979, Tuesday","Mr. Mullen became head of the West Virginia Office of Economic and Community Development on Monday. W. Lovell Higgins, Deputy Commissioner, is acting Commissioner until a successor to Mr. Mullen is namedIn naming him to fill a vacancy created by departure of Donald Moyer, who took over an economic development post in Baltimore, Gov. John D. Rockefeller 4th called Mr. Mullen ""a natural choice.""Mr. Mullen serves on the board of the West Virginia Economic Development Authority, a body which assists community development projects across the state, in tandem with the Office of Economic and Community Development.""He has had an impressive tour of duty in business, in our state's financial community, and also as a participant in this adadministration's program to assist communities in their own economic development efforts,"" the governor said.Mr. Mullen, 40, has served as Banking Commissioner since July 1, 1977.He is a former executive vice president of the Union Trust National Bank, Parkersburg, served as vice president of finance with Kompac convenience stores, was vice president of Wood County Bank, Parkersurg, and worked for nine years for the Borg-Warner Corp., also in Parkersburg."
Court Upholds Merger Pf Two Missouri BHCs Challenged Under CRA,The American Banker,"November 7, 1979, Wednesday","The three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia last week affirmed the agency's order approving the merger of Commerce Bancshares, Inc., Kansas City, with Manchester Financial Corp., St. Louis, without filing an opinion on the decision.The community group, the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, contended that the Fed illegally disregarded lending performance standards for BHC applications established by the CRA. In particular ACORN charged that the Manchester bank failed to give an ""affirmative obligation"" to meet the credit needs of the Manchester-Tower Grove neighborhood, a low and moderate income community, surrounding it. The CRA required such a commitment, ACORN argued.In its June 16, 1978, ruling the Fed said it would have been premature to apply the CRA to the merger application because the law did not become effective until the following November. The past lending records of both BHCs were sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Bank Holding Company Act, the agency added.In an oral hearing on the suit, the Fed told the appeals court that Commerce Bancshares had made five general community lending commitments as a condition to the merger. Those commitments included promises to keep experienced lending officers at the Manchester offices and to continue to meet with community groups.ACORN, however, had wanted written guarantees of future lending practices and gave the court such examples as a mortgage maturing in 30 years with a 5% down payment for secured loans and a 10% down payment for unsecured ones.In March 1978, the agency held a public hearing in St. Louis to determine the effect of the merger on the city."
Chi. Group Studies CRA Statements,The American Banker,"April 6, 1979, Friday","Woodstock Institute plans to send 50 commercial banks and savings and loan associations in the Chicago area letters during the next month pointing out ways in which the statements failed to do what was either required or encouraged by the Federal regulators.Dennis R. Marino, associate director at the institute, said that the institute subsequently plans to examine the institutions' lending performance. It will look at disclosure data, lending volume and participation in reinvestment programs, and it will assess, along with community and public interest groups, the credit needs in an institution's community, he said.The primary goal of the institute's CRA monitoring technical assistance project is to stimulate reinvestment. A secondary goal is to create partnerships between community groups and financial institutions in their local neighborhoods.""We can serve as a technical resource group for both parties and can suggest suitable programs,"" Mr. Marino said, describing a catalytic role for the institute. He said some bankers are unaware of use of the secondary market, private mortgage insurance, co-insurance, state housing finance agency programs and mortgage purchase programs.Another approach is the use of public risk-hedging programs, which involve the use of community development block grants by a local government to guarantee a percentage of a loan, Mr. Marino said.The institute wants banks to look at reinvestment issues, such as unmet demand, and to see what they can do to respond to a community's credit needs, he said.The institute is making itself available to bankers who want to improve their CRA statement or who want to develop new reinvestment programs, Mr. Marino said.Woodstock prepared a CRA statement under contract for the $55.7 million-deposit South Shore Bank, Chicago, Mr. Marino said. The statement was intended to be ""the ideal statement"" and to all raise all important reinvestment issues, he said. A copy of the statement is being sent to all of the 50 institutions.The institute has written a series of research papers for the Missouri Housing Development Commission about bank holding company community development subsidiaries, such as South Shore Bank; private mortgage insurance; mortgage insurance, and S&L service corporations.Established in 1973, Woodstock Institute promotes the revitalization of mature communities and engages in policy analysis and development, consultation and advocacy."
Bankers Say Branch Denial Shows FDIC CRA Toughness,The American Banker,"April 26, 1979, Thursday","The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. last Monday turned down a branch application filed by the $1.5 billion-deposit Greater New York Savings Bank, Brooklyn. This decision on an application filed one year ago has been long awaited by both the banking industry and community groups as a bellwether of how the Federal banking agencies would enforce CRA.The first point which emerges from conversations with highly placed sources is that FDIC is serious about enforcing CRA. ""We're going to uphold the law,"" said one source in discussing the Greater New York case. Another suggested that FDIC, in its first decision on a CRA case, wanted to encourage compliance with the law.Informants suggested that this decision had a particular message for savings banks in New York State. ""In a savings bank, mortgage lending is important,"" one said. He said savings banks should try to meet credit demands in their respective communities and should consider increasing mortgage originations in their communities and help local housing rehab efforts and community development activities.A second point which emerges is that the FDIC is looking for a continuous, rather than temporary, record in meeting local credit needs. Sources said a negative vote Was cast by an FDIC board member because he felt there had ""not been a long enough track record."" One source said the bank's lending had not been ""substantial and lasting.""FDIC's Tuesday statement about its decision said Greater New York had taken positive steps, including advertising, contacts with real estate brokers and meetings with community groups. However, sources said while the steps were good, the ""proof of the pudding"" would be whether increased loans actually result from those steps.The percentage of Greater New York's current funds committed to mortgages in Brooklyn, although increasing, remains at a fairly low level, the statement said.A third point which emerges is that a bank's affirmative steps and community activities are not a ""perfect substitute"" for mortgage originations. The Federal agencies are placing special emphasis on the latter factor, provided that there is unmet demand and that loans can be made safely.On Monday, FDIC chairman Irvine H. Sprague and FDIC director William M. Isaac voted against the application, while H. Joe Selby, a senior deputy comptroller acting for Comptroller John G. Heimann, voted for it.Sources said the affirmative vote reflected a belief by Comptroller Office staff that the bank had been making a sincere effort to change its Record, and that it was consistent with the purpose of CRA to encourage banks to meet local credit needs. On the other hand, staff felt the bank's delineated its community too narrowly, sources said.The FDIC statement rejected a contention of discrimination made by South Brooklyn Against Investment Discrimination, a Park Slope, Brooklyn, group which filed the main objection to the application. A 1977 FDIC investigation found no evidence of discrimination in the bank's lending policies, property appraisals, mortgage origination personnel or collection policies, the statement said.In fact, FDIC's statement basically complimented the bank for its improvement and suggested that if it continued its current trend it can expect application approval for the branch it sough, on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, possibly early in 1980.The statement, in a possible message to community groups, cautioned that it would not impose specific lending terms or direct a bank to make a particular loan or type of loan.A regulator observed, ""For CRA to operate, a community and a bank in that community have to get together about what services the bank ought to provide."" Over time, he suggested, there may be a better meeting of the minds of the two parties, decision may encourage community groups to look more closely at local banks' CRA statements, he noted."
BAI Slates 4 CRA Seminars,The American Banker,"January 16, 1979, Tuesday","The seminars are scheduled for Jan. 16 in Columbus, Jan. 18 in Atlanta, Jan. 23 in Dallas and Jan. 25 in Denver. Nearly 500 bankers attended two previous seminars held last year in Chicago and Washington.Representatives of the Federal Reserve Board, the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. will make presentations at each seminar and be available for questioning.The new Community Reinvestment Act calls on banks to make affirmative efforts to meet the credit needs of their communities. Banks are ""encouraged"" to seek the views of all segments of their communities regarding the residents' credit needs, and will be required to indicate in public statements the extent of their efforts to meet those needs. Certain actions by banks under the act are required on or before Feb. 4.The seminar programs will clarify the new regulations and enable attendees to integrate the requirements in their banks. Speakers will explain how to delineate a bank's community, how to determine community credit needs, and how to prepare the required CRA Statement.Speakers will also discuss public inspection files, recordkeeping requirements, revised application procedures, Federal agency assessment and examination procedures, and the role of public interest groups.The Federal Reserve Board will be represented by the attorney for the consumer affairs division Robert C. Plows, and the assistant to the staff director for management Paul M. Metzger, who will attend alternate seminars. The CRA coordinator for the FDIC, Jeffrey A. Tisdate, will speak at all four seminars.The Comptroller of the Currency will be represented in Columbus by Janet Gordon of the Office of Customer and Community Programs, Washington; in Denver by James Crozier, regional consumer specialist; in Atlanta, by Maria I. Richmond, regional director for customer and community affairs, and in Dallas by Raynaldo Gonzales, assistant national bank examiner.Speakers also will include representatives from banks in each seminar area.For further information, contact David A. Rioux at BAI, 312/693-7300."
Public Relations -- Corporate Responsibility,The American Banker,"July 11, 1979, Wednesday","With this in mind, it seems odd that public relations is not high on the priority list of most bankers. If bankers strive to increase top-of-mind awareness through advertising and promotion, it would appear natural for them to devote as much time and energy to the public relations efforts of their organizations. Public relations, as defined by the Bank Marketing Association and the Bank Administration Institute, is ""a continuing program of activities and communications conceived and designed to identify and involve a bank favorably in the social, civic, cultural, spiritual, educational, ecological and economic welfare of its community and country.""This is quite a mandate. However, bankers can make great strides in each of these seven categories once they realize that public relations is not the sole responsibility of one individual; it is the responsibility of each employee. The chief executive officer alone cannot address all the components of an elaborate public relations plan.Every bank employee -- from the calling officer to operational staff -- has a public relations responsibility. What differentiates their participation in the public relations program is the specific public they address.The banking industry must address many different ""publics."" Some of them are our customers and therefore require special recognition and consideration. Potential customers constitute a different public. And yet another segment consists of the community at large. Media, legislators, businessmen, shareholders -- all need to be addressed in the public relations program. And each bank employee should keep in mind the goals of the public relations program as he interfaces with his customers. With the educated participation of every staff member the public relations plan can impact virtually every public the bank needs to address.Backing the efforts of the staff in large banks is a cadre of public relations specialists who understand that public relations is much more than free advertising.These public relations specialists have the additional responsibility of not only educating the public about the bank as an institution but also educating bank staff about the publics it serves.In small banks where there is no defined public relations staff the chief executive officer may have no one person to coordinate his public relations program. He then must consider whether he want to hire outside consultants or if wants to assume the day-to-day responsibility himself.If the chief executive officer impresses upon his staff the importance of a public relations program, his organization will become more than a receptacle of community funds. It will become a living organism, which contributes to the general well-being of the community at large.Unfortunately, the Federal government has decided that our responsibilities to the community may have been overlooked in the public relations plans of most banks. The challenge we now face as bankers -- to address and recognize our social responsibility -- is reflected in the Community Reinvestment Act. Although many bankers have through the years maintained a consistent and ongoing program of reinvesting in our communities, we now must document it, analyze it and, if needed, improve upon our actions.At first glance the CRA may not appear to have any public relations implications. However, through our participation in the CRA banks establish themselves in the community as concerned corporate citizens. And our participation in the CRA addresses each of the seven categories outlined in the BMA definition of public relations.Certainly, the financing of community projects to help the community grow and prosper may not appear on the surface to be in the best interest of the bank's shareholders and depositors, since the risk is generally greater and the rate of return low -- if a rate of return exists at all. However, we must realize that a bank which goes about its business receiving deposits and making loans, considering just the safety of those deposits and the rate of return on investments, is not fulfilling its role in the community.Through the CRA communities more than ever will look to the bank and its CEO for the resources to foster growth, to make the community a better place for business to function, a better place for people to live.The CEO must convey the message to shareholders and depositors alike that if the community does not prosper, neither will the bank. And therefore these types of social programs/public relations programs can have long-lasting effects which are truly in the bank's future best interest.As our market becomes more and more sophisticated, we continue to discover new ways to implement our public relations plans. We can take a potential problem, such as the CRA, and turn it into a public relations opportunity.What we need to develop, however, is a public relations attitude which is straightforward. Of course such a policy will place the bank and its senior management in positions which occasionally call for delicate dialogue with the public. But with professional advice from the PR specialist, who usually sits between the bank and the outside world, we can build a rapport that will benefit our organizations and the markets we serve."
Banks Assisted At CRA Seminar,The American Banker,"February 9, 1979, Friday","The CRA requires lending institutions to describe their local communities and list the principal types of credit extended in those communities such as: residential, housing rehabilitation, home improvement, small business, farm, community development, commercial, and consumer.The act also encourages lending institutions to describe both their efforts to ascertain the credit needs of the communities they serve and efforts to communicate with members of the communities regarding credit needs and services.The seminar's objective was to assist Commonwealth National's banks in preparing CRA statements to fulfill their requirements under the act.Discussion leaders and their general topics were:Herbert W. Kauffman Jr., executive vice president/corporate division, general comments relative to Commonwealth National and an overview of CRA; John Muir, vice president/consumer loans department, CRA statement, delineation, maps, and types of credit available; Edwin R. Ellis, assistant vice president and business development officer, CRA notice, recordkeeping, and public inspection; Robert P. Williams, assistant vice president and business development officer, meeting community needs, ascertaining community credit needs, and periodic reports; and James Campbell, attorney with the law firm of Nauman, Smith, Shissler & Hall, assessing CRA records of performance.Commonwealth National Bank serves 60 correspondent banks in 21 central Pennsylvania counties."
FDIC Office Hit On CRA Protests,The American Banker,"December 7, 1979, Friday","The letter from the community group, addressed to Cynthia Lewis, FDIC regional adviser, said the agency gave 10 days' notice for Nov. 13 hearings on a branch, Brooklyn. This allegedly rendered the group unable to gather all community representatives who wished to attend.The protest marks the first time the agency has looked at a bank's performance in meeting credit needs of the depressed bedford-Stuyvesant area of Brooklyn.The protest says that the bank made only 2.3% of its 1977 real estate loans in Brooklyn as opposed to 23% in Nassau and Suffolk Counties. The complaint also alleges that the bank discouraged low-income area residents from making mortgage applications, said Janet Irons, a Bank on Brooklyn staff worker.The agency recently granted a Dec. 4 extension for written testimony to be submitted.The hearings are called ""informal procedures"" and no formal hearing procedure or appeals process exists under the CRA.According to the letter, Ms. Lewis had said of the hearings, ""The FDIC is not swayed by emotional statements. The FDIC looks at the facts.""""The informal proceedings are just a chance for community groups to blow off steam.""The remarks allegedly occured in a phone conversation with Ms. Irons when Ms. Lewis informed the group of the Nov. 13 hearing date.Josephine Dismore, president of the group, said in the letter, ""It is hardly necessary for me to comment on the bias shown by these statements.""The letter also said that the agency's ""lack of concern for community groups"" implies that it relies solely on past performance records from a bank in evaluating CRA protests, ignoring testimony from the community.Reached by phone Friday, Ms. Lewis said her comments were lifted out of context by the group and do not reflect her attitude or that of the agency. But she would not comment on the true context of the statements, saying that would ""open up"" the dispute.Ms. Irons said the remarks came after she questioned the 10-day notification in the phone conversation.Ms. Lewis said she has been working in good faith with community groups and the complaint from the group is not typical of her relations with them.She said the group had known for months of the hearings because they filed their objection in August. But she conceded the group ""did not receive that much notice.""Ms. Irons said the group filed an objection in August but only knew in mid-October that the agency would hold hearings.The agency had a backlog of applications when Ms. Lewis assumed her newly created position and applications had to be handled quickly, Ms. Lewis said. She contacts community groups as soon as she has a firm hearing date and, due to the reduction in backlog, this now should allow more advance notification than in the Roosevelt instance.There are no firm guidelines on advance notification and the agency's regional office is still awaiting a letter from the group requesting a mandatory 30-day notice. The letter will be forwarded to Washington for final decision, she said.There are also no firm guidelines on the weight given to testimony relative to past performance, but the record is taken as a whole. She said she has seen no evidence that testimony is ignored."
CofC Defends 'Yes' on CRA Vote,The American Banker,"May 2, 1979, Wednesday","The application had been protested under the Community Reinvestment Act, and an FDIC statement on the 2-to-1 vote issued last week said the decision was made on the basis of an unfavorable finding on the bank meeting the convenience and needs of the community.In a formal written statement released Tuesday explaining his office's dissenting vote, Mr. Heimann said, ""Applications can and should be favorably treated, even in cases where the institution's lending record may fall short of desired levels, if it is clear that the institution has undertaken significant good-faith efforts to improve its lending performance.The national bank regulator stressed that the denial order noted that the $1.5 billion-deposit savings bank had made recent efforts to improve its community lending record and to respond to the law.""I believe that the applicant's efforts have been sufficient to warrant approval, with the understanding that considerable additional and continuing progress would be expected of this applicant and that this progress would be the subject of careful evaluation during future examinations and action on future applications,"" the dissenting statement said.In denying the application, the agency said that the percentage of the bank's funds committed to mortgages in the Brooklyn area, although increasing, remains at a fairly low level. However, a continuation of the trend could result in a favorable CRA assessment, possibly in early 1980.Acting for Mr Heimann, Joe. H. Selby, senior deputy comptroller for operations, voted to approve the application.The application had been closely watched as a test case of how the Federal regulatory agencies would apply the law.Filed about a year ago, the application was approved by the New York State Banking Board last September.The denial was a victory for South Brooklyn's Against Investment Discrimination, the principal community group protesting the application.In November, 1977, the bank announced an affirmative action program in which it accepted a target of $25 million annual investment in residential mortgage loans in New York City.In the last few months the bank had also taken other steps to increase its community lending record, such as opening mortgage lending to non-depositors, reducing the required down payment on five-to eight-family home mortgage loans and increasing the maximum on all loans from $75,000 to $100,000.""The mandate to the financial regulatory agencies under the Community Reinvestment Act is . . . ""to encourage regulated financial institutions to fulfill their continuing and affirmative obligations to help meet the credit needs of their communities,"" Mr. Heimann said. ""I believe the agencies should provide this encouragement in a manner which supports genuine and substantial efforts by financial institutions to comply with the objectives of the law."
Bankers Reassured on CRA Regulation,The American Banker,"January 26, 1979, Friday","Regulatory officials say the agencies are instructing their examiners to follow a balanced viewpoint in enforcing CRA. They add that the agencies will look at the totality of a bank's record under CRA, not at one assessment factor, and sometimes will approve an application despite a negative CRA record.Examiners can readily determine what is right or wrong under the specific Truthin-Lending law, but under the more general CRA there will be a lot more situations requiring judgment and experience. CRA is more difficult to teach examiners, and they will need exposure to actual fact situations in order to learn how to interpret the findings.Complaints from community groups will cause examiners to delve deeper into a bank's lending activities, agency officials say. Examiners will check whether a bank's CRA statement gerrymanders out low-income parts of a community.Fed examiners are being told to watch for a low loan-to-deposit ratios, a lack of retail lending or other warning signals, which could require evaluation of an application at the Washington rather than regional level of the Federal Reserve System.Meanwhile, the Fed's general counsel has endorsed a banker's suggestion that banks start and maintain a nonpublic CRA compliance file for use in responding to protests from community groups. This file would be in addition to the public file which is required under CRA.These approaches on CRA were articulated here by agency officials attending a recent CRA seminar sponsored by Law & Business, Inc. and attended by about 25 bank lawyers.Participating in the New York seminar were: Neal L. Petersen, general counsel, Board of Governors, Federal Reserve System; John D. Hawke, Jr., attorney, Arnold & Porter, Washington, and former general counsel at the Fed; Jeffrey Tisdale, CRA coordinator, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., Washington; JoAnn S. Barefoot, director of customer and community programs, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Washington; James V. Elliott, director of bank organization and structure, Comptroller's office, Washington; Jonathan A. Brown, attorney, Public Interest Research Group, Washington; Jerauld C. Kluckman, associate director of the division of consumer affairs, Federal Reserve System, Washington; and Carl Felsenfeld, vice president, Citibank NA, New York.CRA regulations began applying last Nov. 6 to Federally-insured commercial banks, mutual savings banks and savings and loan associations. These institutions must adopt a CRA statement for each local community they serve; the deadline for approval of the CRA statement by the institutions' board of directors, and availability of the statement in each branch, is Feb. 4.A bank's CRA statement must include for each local community a map delineating that local community, a list of the types of credit it is prepared to extend in that community, and a copy of the CRA notice. Banks also are encouraged to describe current efforts to meet community credit needs and to try to ascertain those needs.At the seminar, Mr. Tisdale and Mr. Elliott recommended that banks which are developing their CRA statements keep in mind the areas where: they are conducting their marketing programs; their depositors are located; credit currently is being extended; and its offices are situated. Mr. Tisdale said the required map could be drawn on a street and road map.Mr. Felsenfeld said that banks already have a good sense of their community and of the community's needs. ""Don't ignore your experience and knowledge"" in drawing up a CRA statement, he suggested.Mr. Brown said that community groups, in analyzing a bank's CRA statement, will be looking for types of loans a bank is making and its loan terms.Mr. Tisdale noted that banks do not have to send a copy of their CRA statements to their regulators. However, he said, when a bank applies for an application, it should include a copy of the CRA statement.Replying to a question, Mr. Elliott said two tests of a CRA statement are whether it is reasonable and whether it excludes low-hoods.William T. Nachbaur, senior counsel at Bank of America NT&SA, San Francisco, said in an interview that BofA plans to use one CRA statement for the state of California, along with a map of the whole state. The statement and map will be condensed into a four-page, 8.5inch-by 11-inch booklet for public distribution, he said. BofA is considering its nine regions to be its local communities for purposes of CRA.Mr. Nachbaur observed that BofA's use of one CRA statement stems from ""pretty unique"" conditions, particularly the fact BofA has over 1,100 branches in California.Banks were encouraged at the seminar to work with community groups.Mr. Felsenfeld said it was riskier to ignore groups than to try to work with them. Banks should be selective in choosing them, he said, and should ""be sure they're on your side"" before controversial applications come up. ""The crunch will come"" when banks are looking for regulatory approval of branch or other applications, and community groups are called on to express themselves, Mr. Feslsenfeld said.Mr. Petersen warned that protest from community groups may very well increase in number and seriousness.Ms. Barefoot suggested that banks look for groups with official status, perhaps those recommended by city housing officials, and be willing to schedule meetings with them on evenings and weekends. The key to success in working with community groups is openness of attitude and willingness to listen, she said, adding: ""Good will on your part will generate good will on their part.""Mr. Tisdale noted that the public file was intended to give community groups some input into the policy-making procedures of the institution.The importance of good communications in the post-CRA period was underscored by several speakers. Mr. Tisdale advised that banks engaged in preparation of the CRA statement keep in mind the importance of communicating effectively with examiners and the public, as well as the ""vast marketing potential"" of using the CRA statement to show what they are doing for the local community.A lawyer representing a Washington bank observed at the seminar: ""Our policies haven't changed but we learned we had to beat on our own drum. We have to positively accentuate what we've been doing, or it will be assumed we're not doing it.""The responsibility of a bank's board in considering CRA statements also was discussed at the CRA seminar. Mr. Felsenfeld said he anticipated that at Citibank the full board would consider CRA standards. A committee of the board, he said, would make a preliminary review of the statements and keep an eye on the bank's performance relative to the promise of the statement.Mr. Peterson told the bank lawyers that the full board ultimately takes responsibility for the CRA statements. He said there were ""very serious"" consequences for directors who ignore CRA statements of their banks.He foresaw the possibility that bank stockholders would file suit against directors of the bank if an application representing important business opportunities was denied due to the bank's poor CRA record. Such shareholder suits were ""pretty likely to happen,"" he said.The role of bank examiners in implementing CRA was discussed in interviews with seminar participants. Asked how examiners are reacting to CRA, Mr. Kluckman said some examiners were concerned that the CRA guidelines were not specific. The examiners require a lot more experience with CRA, he said.Asked the same question, Mr. Tisdale of thm FDIC said reaction among examiners was favorable, though some felt ""some anxiety"" about determining the reasonableness of a bank's performance under CRA. He did not think they would have much difficulty implementing CRA.At both the Fed and FDIC, examiner training specifically about CRA consisted of a session lasting about a day and a half. Generally, the Fed's consumer examiners who will be conducting CRA checks have one to three years' commercial experience.Meanwhile, the Fed, FDIC and the Comptroller recently held four regional seminars for senior office personnel to raise the level of awareness about CRA application and examination procedures.During the Law & Business discussion, Mr. Kluckman said the Fed's examiners would check for compliance under CRA as part of the consumer exam, the date for which normally is known to the bank in advance. However, the consumer exam could be conducted at the same time as the commercial exam, which is usually unannouced.Mr. Kluckman explained that the CRA check would consist of determining whether the bank's definition of community was reasonable, evaluating the previously announced 12 assessment factors with am emphasis on low-and moderate-income neighborhoods, and procedural matters such as verifying that the CRA notice is posted.Assessment factors include: activities by a bank to ascertain the credit needs of its community; extent of participation by the bank's board of directors in formulating CRA policies and reviewing CRA performance; practices to discourage applications for credit; and the bank's participation in local community development programs.Examiners will be very interested in communication between the bank and community and will pay particular attention to the public file, Mr. Kluckman said.The bank will be given a brief questionnaire, when the examiner enters the bank or previously by mail, asking what it has done to meet its CRA obligation, Mr. Kluckman said.The associate director of the Fed's consumer affairs division also said examiners will have the right to make ""outside contact,"" for example, with persons who have sent a letter contained in the public file or with community groups, to see how the bank is meeting CRA requirements.Ms. Barefoot, discussing circumstances when examiners would probe deeper into a bank's performance under CRA, said ""the starting point will be heavily focused on complaints from a community.""Mr. Kluckman stressed that comments made by examiners to a bank's management about improving its CRA performance would be in the form of suggestions and not demands -- in a tone of encouragement, not insistence.One page of the consumer exam report will be devoted to CRA assessment; that page will not be made public, but will be given to the bank.The Fed, FDIC, Comptroller's, and Federal Home Loan Bank Board will use a rating system of one to five -- one is the best -- in rating a bank's performance under CRA.The rating will not be disclosed to the bank or to community groups, Mr. Kluckman said.Mr. Kluckman said in an interview the rating would be considered when applications are reviewed and that it would be shared with other Federal banking regulatory agencies. He pointed out that the basis of reasons for the rating would be contained in the single-page CRA assessment.Ms. Barefoot said the regulators would be looking to see if such segments were ""gerrymandered out."" Similarly, Mr. Brown warned against leaving out lower-and moderate-income segments of a community.Examiners with the different regulatory agencies may use geocoding to learn the geographic distribution of loans and applications, particularly in low-and modeerate-income neighborhoods. Geocoding would involve taking a sample or total of a bank's loans or rejected applications and plotting them on a map.Geocoding will be used on an experimental basis at the examiners' discretion, Mr. Kluckman said. It would be very costly to do in all exams, he added. In addition, the Fed and other regulatory agencies plan to participate in a geocoding experiment.Mr. Kluckman said in an interview that examiners can readily determine bank activities which are acceptable under the Truth-in-Lending Act, which is relatively specific. CRA, on the other hand, is a more general law and a lot more situations require the examiners' judgments and experience in order to interpret the findings.CRA is more difficult to teach examiners, Mr. Kluckman said, and examiners need exposure to actual fact situations in CRA exams.""We've stressed a balanced viewpoint"" to examiners, Mr. Kluckman said.In a suggestion for banks on CRA, Mr. Hawke said bankers ought not to lose sight of ""a personal dimension to examiner evaluation."" Bankers should cooperate with examiners and make their task easier by having all CRA information ready, he suggested.Agency officials offered some guidance for banks submitting applications at the present time and up until the CRA statement is required.Mr. Petersen recommended that banks submit a CRA-related narrative which discusses assessment factors. In addition, he recommended that banks preparing current applications talk to local officials of their supervising agency about CRA materials which should be submitted.Mr. Tisdale noted that FDIC-supervised banks currently submitting applications should also send a narrative, but one commenting on past and future policies or practices rather than the assessment factors.Mr. Petersen noted that at present applications are sometimes processed entirely at the regional Federal Reserve Bank, and some will continue to be processed at the regional level. But, under CRA, applications will automatically go to Washington for evaluation if they are protested or if regional officials feel the institutions have some deficiency in their CRA record.Another difference in treatment of applications is that under CRA the public will have notice of applications, a notice they previously did not receive from the Fed, Mr. Petersen said.The Fed's staff, he said, has been told to watch for these warning signals which could warrant evaluation of an application at the Washington level: low loan-to-deposit ratios lack of retail lending; previous adverse consumer compliance examinations; and disparity of service to low-hoods.To improve chances of favorable CRA consideration, Mr. Petersen said, it might be a good idea for banks to keep an internal file in addition to the required public file.Larger banks may want to put relevant information on computer to have ready for responding to protests, Mr. Petersen said.Mr. Petersen was commenting on a recommendation by Mr. Nachbaur. In remarks prepared for a canceled Law & Business seminar in San Francisco, Mr. Nachbaur recommended that financial institutions create a nonpublic compliance file(s) which would document their CRA activities and records.This compliance file, Mr. Nachbaur said, would be used to show compliance under CRA to examiners, to defend applications and to reply to comments on CRA statements. To the extent possible, the information in the file should be separated according to local community, he said. File contents could be made public as appropriate.Mr. Nachbaur recommended that the compliance file contain: documentation of outreach efforts, such as memos regarding speeches and meetings, and ad copy about credit services; board participation, including insider director participation in development of CRA action; efforts to uncover practices which discourage applictions, such as a survey of real estate agents or an inquiry as to whether some credit services are targeted only to high income areas, for example based on zip code; geographic distribution of loans (Home Mortgage Disclosure and Equal Credit Opportunity data); evidence of nondiscrimination; procedures for deciding to open or close offices which require consideration of impact on low- to moderate-income areas; community development programs, such as participation in Neighborhood Housing Service programs or memberships on community development corporation boards; loan origination policies, including dollar totals by loan category if available; and participation in government programs.Mr. Nachbaur said in the interview the nonpug into the hands of the public or competitors.Mr. Nachbaur noted two ways BofA is responding to CRA. Firstly, each branch manager will contact city planning officials, neighborhood groups, and others to inform them of the types of credit the bank is willing to extend. Secondly, the bank is making efforts to see if it can increase use of Federal programs, such as those of the Federal Housing Administration.At the seminar, Mr. Petersen told the bank lawyers that a bank's appointment of a community reinvestment officer or one with CRA responsibilities will reflect well in its application.Regulators were asked what information is required under CRA for banks submitting applications for regulatory approval. Mr. Petersen said the Fed will consider an application on CRA matters complete if the application indicates a good faith effort to discuss past performance - especially if it submits quantitative information on the number and types of loans it has made.The Fed, he said, also will be especially inclined to consider an application complete if the application indicates some awareness of whether there are low-and moderate-income neighborhoods in its community and some indication of how those neighborhoods were treated in the past or will be treated in the future.Mr. Petersen suggested that if a bank had a poor lending record and was seeking regulatory approval of an application, the agency could ""negotiate"" with the bank. There is no point in denying an application, he said, since the purpose of CRA is to encourage banks to improve their record on CRA matters.In response to a question, Mr. Petersen said there is no formal plan to require a written promise to take future action if a bank's CRA record is unsatisfactory.Ms. Barefoot emphasized that the Comptroller's office would look at the ""totality"" of a bank's CRA record, not just one assessment factor. Mr. Petersen noted that a negative CRA record did not mean that a bank's application always would be turned down.Panelists also discussed affirmative uses of CRA. A bank could enlist the support of a community group for its application or could challenge a competitor's application because it had a poor CRA record.Mr. Brown, discussing the case of two institutions seeking the same site, said community groups would be interested in supporting the institution with the best CRA record. However, he said, a bank should have a long and good working relationship with a community group before it expects a group's support.Mr. Elliott raised the possibility of using a community group as an ally. He described a situation where two bank holding companies in Texas might seek permission to open a new bank in a new banking area. The company with a good CRA record might obtain the support of a community group and have an advantage in the application process, he suggested.One unresolved issue at the seminar was which party has the burden of proof in a protested application: the bank or the community group. Panelists generally felt that the agencies would continue the line of reasoning of the Federal Reserve Board, which said in a 1975 decision concerning Marine Midland Banks, Inc., Buffalo, N.Y., that ""the objecting party assumes the burden of showing that a particular statutory factor has not been satisfied by the applicant.""Mr. Brown disagreed, saying that once a pattern of lending discrimination had been demonstrated, the bank had the burden of proving otherwise.Discovery and procedural issues also were debated at the seminar. An unresolved issue is whether community groups could obtain release of annual assessments of CRA performance under the Freedom of Information Act for use in challenging applications.Panelists also discussed the idea of community groups asking the Fed to issue a subpoena requiring the bank to provide previously-undisclosed information, which they would use to document their challenge.Mr. Hawke noted that in bank holding company cases, the Fed has argued it did not have the authority to issue subpenas and authorize discovery by protestants. But, he pointed out, the Financial Institutions Regulatory Act passed last year contains a provision giving the Fed authority to issue subpenas in bank holding company proceedings. As a result, community groups might receive favorable action in court if they sought information necessary to their case.Also at the seminar, panelists discussed the use of formal hearings if applications are protested. Mr. Tisdale said the agencies have the discretion of holding formal or informal hearings if applications are protested.Mr. Elliott noted that the Comptroller's office now receives many protests from competing institutions -- in some unnamed regions, every application is contested, he said. Thus, the Comptroller's office already has the hearing procedures and experienced staff to deal with CRA protests.FDIC's regional office has held two hearings on protested applications since the advent of CRA. Those dealt with applications of Greater New York Savings Bank and the Northside Savings Bank, the Bronx. The FDIC's regional office also held hearings during that time when banks objected to approval on competitive grounds.Claude C. Phillippe, regional director of the FDIC's office in New York, presided over both meetings. They were held in late afternoon or evening, giving community group members the opportunity to attend after work. The hearings are conducted to give objectors the chance to express their views. The Northside hearing was held Jan. 24. The basic format of the hearing is each side speaks, then gives a rebuttal, followed by questions and answers. Hearings can be informal, as in the case of Northside, or formal, and are conducted at the discretion of the FDIC.In answer to a question about what constituted a protest of an application, a panelist said a protest could be triggered by one ""responsible, well thought out, substantative"" letter from one individual.Two cases expected to give significant indication of how CRA will be enforced are a branch application submitted by the Greater New York Savings Bank, Brooklyn, and a court challenge of the Fed's approval of an application of Commerce Banchshares, Inc., Kansas City, to merge with Manchester Financial Corp., St. Louis.Seminar panelists pointed out that the designers of CRA tried to avoid the specificity and detail of the Truth-in-Lending Law because of the problems which that regulatory approach created for banks.Mr. Brown observed that the foremost purpose of CRA had been obscured. The purpose was to promote reinvestment in disinvested urban neigborhoods, he said, but the act and the agencies' regulations deal with the credit needs of the entire community.Ms. Barefoot, who was working for the Senate Banking Committee when CRA was passed by Congress, recalled that CRA was intended to provide an impetus to put each financial institution through a thought process about which credit nemds in its community it could meet, and to promote dialogue between the institution and the community.Mr. Brown said that large commercial banks appear more willing to make mortgage and home improvement loans than thrifts, which he said show ""less ability to deal with change.""Mr. Petersen was asked whether a bank's ""abysmal"" lending record before CRA would be held against it, though it planned to change future policies. Mr. Petersen replied that such an indication of change would be ""favorably received"" and that the bank's past record would not be held against it.Another question was how CRA affects a bank's decision to close a branch. Mr. Petersen said that agency approval of closure was not required, but that the closure would become a factor in the bank's record which would be consulted if the bank submitted an application later on.Mr. Tisdale was asked whether a bank could draw its community only from its depositors. He replied that the needs of the area were important, as were depositors' needs, and said the depositor-only concept was at variance with the purpose of CRA.The CRA seminar was sponsored by Law & Business, Inc., a subsidiary of Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, publishers of Legal Times of Washington newspaper.Mr. Felsenfeld noted that CRA is a statute of principle rather than one of specific instruction. The principle is that banks owe an obligation to their communities, an obligation which can be met in different ways, he said.CRA should be perceived as an opportunity to use regulatory freedom, he said. Bankers should use this opportunity to show that an absence of regulation is something they are comfortable with and can handle constructively, he proposed.""Overregulation comes not from incompetence of regulators as much as the efforts of us bankers and our lawyers to get direction,"" he said."
"CRA Keeps Mass. Banking Chief Occupied; Law Delays Plans of Two Cleveland BCHs;
Fed also Under Fire",The American Banker,"December 4, 1979, Tuesday","The Buckeye-Woodland Community Congress and the Union-Miles Community Coalition have taken on Ohio's largest bank, the $3.1 billion-deposit Ameritrust, formerly Cleveland Trust Co. The Union-Miles group is battling the $1.2 billion-deposit Society National Bank.The Buckeye organization last summer accused Ameritrust of unfair loan practices which it said were destroying the Buckeye-Woodland neighborhood.The group also severely criticized the Federal Reserved Board's investigation of the charges against Ameritrust.The Fed issued a report last month detailing the bank's mortgage loan activity in 1977 and 1978.""It seems as if the Federal Reserve Board only shows Cleveland Trust's side,"" said Sharon M. Bryant, Congress spokesman.The Congress challenged the bank's plans to open a branch on East 22d Street and to acquire banks in Columbus, Painesville, Lorain and Cincinnati under the Federal Community Reinvestment Act.Mrs. Bryant said the Fed report ignored many of the issues the Congress raised. These include charges that the bank has pre-screened loan applicants and refused to let some people fill out loan applications.She also said the bank refused to make government-insured loans, which require a smaller down payment, and also racially discriminated against mortgage loan applicants. Mrs. Bryant said the group submitted affidavits from seven black applicants, but that those were ignored.The Fed report said that in 1977 the bank made 12 home mortgage loans in Buckeye-Woodland, or 4.6% of the number it made in Cleveland. In 1978, the bank made 31 home mortgages, or 12.5% of the city volume.However, Cleveland Trust made only 260 home loans in the city in 1977, 16.3% of its business, the report said. In 1978, it made 248 mortgage loans, or 15.6% of its business and city residents.Also discussed in the report were loans for home improvements and the bank's rejection rate for mortgage and home improvement loans.The report stated four times that Fed investigator could find no evidence that loans had been rejected ""on any discriminatory basis prohibited.""A spokesman for Ameritrust said the report clearly shows that the community's community group charges were without basis.Martin Abrams, spokesman for the Fed, said the report did not attempt to draw conclusions.Mr. Abrams said Fed investigators will eventually present a recommendation of the community group's charges to its board of governors, but that recommendation would not be made public.The board will decide whether to allow Ameritrust to expand, he said.The Union-Miles coalition has charged that Society refused mortgage and home improvement loans to applicants from Cleveland's southeast side despite having the largest savings deposit of any bank (more than $11,300,000.00) form residents in the area.Gordon E. Heffern, Society president, said his bank has ""fully complied with both the print and letter of the new law"".Union-Miles filed its protest with the Comptroller of the Currency about Society's neighborhood lending last July, after the bank has asked for the government's approval to open five branches in Lake County and merge with a bank in southern Ohio.""We are really treading new ground,"" said David Hoffman, Deputy Regional Administrator for the Comptroller. ""There is really no set procedure because so far we have only had three requests for a hearing.""If a decision is reached to investigate the bank's lending practices based on the neighborhood group's charges, Mr. Hoffman said the results will be sent to the agency's Washington headquarters.He did not know how long the government would take before ruling on the protest.Union-Miles representatives ask that Society be forced to start pre-loan counseling and improve its small loan efforts in the area.The neighborhood group made the same protest concerning Society to the Federal Reserve Bank under another provision of the law.J. Maurice Struchen, chairman and chief executive officer of Society Corp., told the Cleveland security analysts last week, that the two community groups were using the 1977 Community Reinvestment Act to block the merger of society's smaller affiliate, First National Bank of Clermont County, into its Society National Bank.D. Allen McDaniel, the bank holding company's senior vice president-operations, said Society hopes to settle the issues between the parties by the first quarter of 1980 so that Society can proceed with the merger. He said Society hopes a settlement before the Comptroller also will clear the way for the acquisition of second National Bank of Bucyrus."

Mass. Bill for a Stake CRA Prepared: Challenged Mo. Acquisition approved,The American Banker,"December 6, 1979, Thursday","Sen. John Brennan, D. Malden, said his intent is to require banks to be more responsive to their neighborhood's credit needs by limiting the number of communities within their lending area. The bill, he added, is similar to one which died in the 1979 session, but is significantly different in the way it changes the definition of lending areas. The 1980 bill would also establish an exact duplicate of the Federal CRA bill, but extend its applicability from those banks now covered by FDIC insurance to all state-chartered banks. Another change would make CRA a state law instead of an administrative procedure adopted by the state banking commission.Sen. Brennan said the prospective change in lending areas was motivated by a request now before the state banking commission by the Provident Institution for Savings to branch from Boston to nearby Newton. That application is being challenged by community groups under the Federal CRA statute.In its application, Provident listed its lending area as extending from Boston to Rte. 495, a state highway about 35 miles away from the city. Sen. Brennan said Provident was thus ""giving new connotations to the term'local.'""He said the Federal CRA gives banks too much freedom to delineate their lending areas. All criteria such as standard metropolitan statistical areas and county lines would be eliminated in the bill, and replaced by ""contiguous cities and towns.""""My intent is to tighten up the delineation of 'local community,'"" Sen. Brennan explained. This was also done, he said, because ""in assessing whether they (banks) are responsive within the Federal CRA guidelines, you look at their policies within lending areas.""If a bank has a smaller lending area than that, he said, they are more apt to meet credit needs and thus conform to CRA guidelines which are applicable when they want to branch or merge.Sen. Brennan said the Provident case is the best example of why he wants to make the change in lending areas. ""It has six downtown Boston offices, four Boston neighborhood branches, and only one suburban location. Clearly the community contemplated by the act (CRA) to be served by the Provident is the major urban center which is the base of its operations.""""For the potential problems for being non-responsive to community needs are far greater in urban areas,"" said Sen. Brennan, who in the past has pushed for strict new anti-redlining statures.""Historically, banks have not been as responsive as they should be to communities,"" he added.In Massachusetts now, the Federal CRA guidelines apply only to state-chartered trust companies and 22 savings banks because of their FDIC insurance.Sen. Brennan's legislation would require banks to define local communities, using his new definition, and to prepare a statement covering its credit activities and efforts in that community. A notice of the new state CRA would have to be displayed in public in the lobby of each bank office, and comments from the public would have to be kept on file for review.The state banking commissioner would also have to assess the bank's performance under the law when considering a bank's application for a branch, merger, or relocation, or consolidation with another bank."

Anchor Savings Joins Neighborhood Unit Group in Rehabilitating Brooklyn Area,The American Banker,"April 13, 1979, Friday","The bank has been instrumental in providing a new facility for a local hospital, restoring dozens of one-and two-family homes, and rebuilding several abandoned multiple-family dwellings.The decline of multiple dwellings, which represent less than a fifth of the area's structures, poses the most serious threat to the community. In the last three years more than 50 charred and gutted apartment buildings have appeared throughout the district.Anchor has provided the development corporation with the financing and expertise necessary to acquire, refurbish and sell or manage foreclosed and abandoned properties.With the support of Anchor the development corporation has been able to establish the 'good track record' necessary to qualify for federal and city funds as the government refocuses its urban development efforts from rebuilding devastated areas to saving 'transitional' communities.Sunset Park's 100,000 residents continue to occupy rows of historic brownstones and other one and two family homes as proof that the district remains viable despite its rapid decline.Kathryn Wylde, who recently joined Anchor as urban Affairs Officer, organized and was the president of the redevelopment committee, while serving as director of community relations for Lutheran Medical Center, which donated her time to the redevelopment effort. The corporation was formed by community residents and businessmen to preserve and renew the district's declining housing stock.She told the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs in January that ""stigmatized as a poor, Puerto Rican neighborhood, Sunset Park was vulnerable to the familiar factors that precipitate overnite devastation: white flight, block busting, real estate speculation, arson, disinvestment by banks and insurance companies, withdrawal of public services, building abandonment, high crime rates and racial tension.""Most of the multiple dwellings were financed by savings banks and savings and loan institutions which held first mortgages and eventually were forced to assume control of the properties.""The disappearance or desperation to sell on the part of the origional owners left the institutions with only one identifiable market: the corporate speculators,"" Ms. Wylde told the committee. ""The banks didn't have the capacity or information to manage, rehabilitate and effectively seek out responsible new owners. They were also pressured by regulatory agencies to quickly strip their portfolio of mortgages gone bad.""Anchor first worked with the redevelopment corporation to convert an abandoned factory for use as the new home for Lutheran Medical Center. The modern, 532-bed medical complex opened in July of 1977, as the cramped building that formerly housed the facility was being renovated as senior citizen housing. Anchor was instrumental in attracting private donations of over $2 million which were used to qualify for a loan from the New York State Medical Care Facilities Finance Agency for $65 million.While the new hospital was under construction, the dimensions of the deteriorated and abandoned housing stock problem were just being realized.Faced with the imminent collapse of a community Anchor was heavily involved in, Donald Thomas, Chairman of the $1.5 billion-deposit savings bank decided something had to be done to save the ""many good landlords who put their life savings into buildings only to have them wiped out by rising tax, fuel, and service costs which couldn't be met because of the rent control laws.""Landlords found that the artificially low rent income prevented building maintenance and jeopardized their ability to meet mortgage payments. As abandoned buildings began to appear, property values fell drastically making it impossible to sell at a reasonable price.Anchor assited in obtaining foundation grants, construction loans, and, through the New York State Savings Bank Mortgage Review Fund and the Brooklyn Association of Federal Savings and Loans, permanent financing which enabled the redevelopment committee to renovate and return to owner occupancy 15 small homes. The project, completed with no government assistance except FHA mortgage insurance, became a model for the renovation of small homes in other New York City neighborhoods.The redevelopment corporation now has a contract with New York City to rehabilitate small homes with an allocation of Federal Community Development funds to subsidize the difference between the cost of rehabilitation and the market price of the home. Typically the group spends $50,000 to $60,000 to restore a home which when completed is appraised by the FHA at $26,000.""It's Anchor's basic policy never to walk away from a property,"" according to Donald Thomas. ""We look at each property to see what best can be done. We say that you should start with the answers and then write the questions.""The abandonment of multiple dwellings was a further obstacle for the Sunset Park Redevelopment Committee. Having pioneered the structuring of construction and permanent financing for the federal Section 8 housing Assistance Payments program in New York State (a rent subsidy program), Anchor was in a positin to supply technical assistance to the corporation for developing applications for federal funding. Anchor, together with Hamilton Federal Savings and Loan association took the unusual step of agreeing to provide conventional, uninsured mortgages for the multiple-dwellings undergoing rehabilitation.The bank held properties in its portfolio during the long periods required for government processing of applications and educated the community group in the complex process of property acquisition for rehabilitation.For Ms. Wylde, this assistance meant more than the financial help. Like most non-profit corporations they had formed with no conception of the complicated real estate and financial world they were entering.Anchor also supported the group with ""political and bureaucratic clout,"" that forced federal and city administrators to take them seriously, she said.In most cases Anchor, as the first mortgagee of a property, can help the redevelopment committee negotiate control. The committee then attempts to attract a private developer/owner to the building. Usually the building is too small to allow a private developer to reconstruct and manage profitably. In the entire Sunset PArk district there are fewer than 100 buildings with more than 20 apartments.Where there is no private sector interest in a property, the committee undertakes the project itself. Interior demolition is carried out in cooperation with the Vera institute, an ex-offenders employment program which provides job skills and a steady paycheck to the former inmates. Private firms are them contracted to construct the building's interior.The completed project will be managed by the committee, with the tenants rent subsidized under the section 8 program. Building management, already an important facet of the committ's program, is certain to increase in importance in the near future.A new law allows New York City to seize property in tax arrears for one year instead of four years, as it was before. When Brooklyn is vested in mid-April, about a dozen multi-families and several hundred one and two family Sunset Park homes will be held in rem by the city. The redevelopment committee expects to be designated manager of these properties by the overwhelmed city housing officials.Brian Sullivan, Senior Planner for the Pratt Institute Center for Community and Environmental Development doesn't know of any bank that has taken an interest in a neighborhood as Anchor has in Sunset Park. ""Something that distinguishes the Sunset Park effort is that Anchor invested in the committee from the outset. It didn't waste time maneuvering and funding studies, but took a chance and cooperated with the community group.""Mr. Sullivan says that the Sunset Park Redevelopment Committee is one of the few groups that has been able to sustain its success over a long period, and that its program is a good model for other communities.Anchor Savings has also been involved in less drastic building rehabilitation efforts in Sunset Park, in cooperation with private owners and the community group. Donald Thomas feels that the key to saving a community is not intervening after properties have already been destroyed, but maintaining those sound structures which have begun to run down.One benefit of Anchor's community program which he didn't envision at the outset is compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, which requires banks to demonstrate positive support for the communities in which they are located. The Act also requires regulatory agencies to assess an institutions support of its community before approving charters, deposit insurance, branches, relocations, consolidations, mergers and acquisitions.Mr. Thomas said that although he deplores ""excessive"" regulation, he feels that because of their record in the Sunset Park Community the CRA could prove to be an asset for his bank."
S&L Must end Hamlet Bias to Get Branch,The American Banker,"June 26, 1979, Tuesday","An FHLBB official said the State Federal Savings & Loan Association, Beatrice, Neb., could continue charging higher rates based on risk, but only after a case-by-case evaluation of each loan application.The population of the communities which the Nebraska S&L categorized as higher risk areas were those generally with between 250 and 5,000 persons, according to Leonard E. Whittaker, president of State Federal.The S&L's lending policies were reviewed by the FHLBB under the requirements of the Community Reinvestment Act, which directs regulators to take into consideration an institution's record in meeting community credit needs when acting on an application to expand facilities.In a CRA case last week, the FHLBB granted conditional approval for two branch office applications from a Toledo, Ohio, savings and loan association, provided the S&L eliminated, for certain parts of the community, a ""customer only"" lending policy during tight-money periods.First Federal Savings & Loan Association of Toledo also was instructed as part of the conditional approval to retain a newly developed home improvement loan program; meet with community groups at least semi-annually; and more clearly define in the CRA statement its intentions to meet the credit needs of low and moderate income residents of its lending territory.State Federal applied for permission to open a branch in Crete, Neb. The application was challenged on competitive grounds by First Federal Savings & Loan Association of Lincoln, and Midwest Federal Savings & Loan Association of Nebraska City, according to FHLBB officials. The protesting S&Ls claimed there was no need for a new branch in the market area, and that there was little probability the proposed branch would generate enough business to succeed, the FHLBB official said.Mr. Whittaker said in an interview Monday that he had ""no quarrel"" with the FHLBB ruling since it did allow for risk calculation on a case-by-case basis.However, he argued that the Community Reinvestment Act ""was designed primarily for metropolitan areas. As with many national laws, it's difficult to take a regulation intended for metropolitan areas and apply it to a very small village in the Midwest.""According to Mr. Whittaker, two years ago State Federal gave one of four classifications to the approximately 60 towns in its lending territory. The classification project was undertaken because the S&L's lending officers believed they often were unfamiliar with small, distant communities from which they were receiving loan applications, he said.The ratings were based on population trends and the availability of municipal services and other amenities, according to Mr. Whittaker. He said many towns, without paved roads, police protection and sewage systems, ""leave just a dickens of a lot to be desired."" He said the S&L believed there would be no market for repossessed homes in these communities, and private mortgage insurance would not cover possible losses to the S&L.Mr. Whittaker said his S&L often is the only financial institution making loans in certain towns. ""If we pull out of the community, a dying town is plain going to die,"" he said.At an FHLBB meeting last April, when the State Federal case first was brought before the board, Alvin Hirshen, director of the FHLBB office of community investment, said that ""the kinds of issues that are brought up here I think have a direct analogy to the policies we've established under the regulations in urban areas.""Mr. Hirshen commented that homes in urban areas also suffer from foreclosures, lack of occupancy, and marketability problems.An FHLBB official here said the agency believed the practice of State Federal was unique and not a policy of other S&Ls in rural areas.James L. Pledger, assistant general counsel for the National Savings and Loan League, said that ""as long as the Bank Board preserved the options of the association to tie the interest rate to the risk, then we think this was a reasonable determination."""

Mass. Bill for a State CRA Prepared: Challenged Mo. Acquisition Approved,The American Banker,"December 6, 1979, Thursday","The application had been challenged under the Community Reinvestment Act.Landmark's application to buy the bank had been opposed by a neighborhood action group. The citizens group and Landmark resolved the redlining dispute under a new Federal Reserve Board policy of seeking negotiated settlements of disagreements arising from the CRA.The opposition was withdrawn when Landmark agreed to improve services at one of its subsidiary banks.In approving the acquisition, the St. Louis Fed did not endorse the agreement between Landmark Bancshares and the Wellston Community Organization, an affiliate of the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now.However, the Fed's order approving the acquisition did take note of the agreement, saying that it had assessed Landmark's ""record of serving the convenience and needs of its communities"" and that Landmark had agreed to ""consult and cooperate with community representatives.""But the Fed said that ""since the (Federal Reserve) Board of Governors has stated that neither the Bank Holding Company Act nor the Community reinvestment Act . . . authorizes the Board to impose conditions to allocate credit, the Reserve Bank (of St. Louis) does not endorse any term of the agreement"" between Landmark and the citizens group.The St. Louis Fed said only that the merger would improve the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of Ladue Bank, and that it would not reduce competition significantly.Under the agreement between Landmark and the Wellston organization, the $80.6-million-deposit Landmark Central Bank & Trust Co., Wellston, will revise its credit standards, provide increased amounts of mortgage and home improvement loans at lower rates, increase its credit marketing efforts, experiment with expanded banking hours and provide other community development assistance.In opposing the acquisition, the Wellston group had contended that the bank was deficient in all of these areas.For several years, Landmark Bancshares, headed by S. Lee Kling, national finance chairman for president Carter's re-election campaign, has sought to gain access to the lucrative Clayton-Ladue, Mo., banking markets.The holding company last year tried to move Landmark Central to Clayton, but was blocked by Missouri banking officials. The firm then arranged the acquisition of Ladue Bank.Landmark is paying $2.45 million, over a four-year period, for the Ladue Bank, which is being renamed Landmark Bank of Ladue. The purchase price was based on a minimim book value of $1.65 million.""We expect substantial growth for Landmark Bank of Ladue,"" Mr. Kling said.Ladue Bank in August moved into a new two-story, 11,000-square-foot building.Landmark, which now has five subsidiary banks in the St. Louis area, is seeking further expansion. The company has applied to the Comptroller of the Currency for a national charter for a bank in suburban Sunset Hills, Mo."
State Street Expected to Keep Fenway Unit Despite Breakdown of Negotiations,The American Banker,"December 14, 1979, Friday","Executive vice president Ted Ward said that the bank is studying several alternatives, all of which include retaining service, to a plan to close its oldest branch, a 75-year-old institution.State Street wants to sell the building in which that branch is located. One plan, apparently favored now, involves leasing space in the same structure from the prospective purchaser, the Berklee School of Music.Earlier this year, the bank withdrew its application to close the branch after community groups, led by the Massachusetts Urban Reinvestment Advisory Group (MURAG), complained that it was violating the spirit of the federal community reinvestment act by potentially denying credit needs to the community.Although the CRA, adopted in regulation form by the state, does not specifically include branch closings, MURAG officials said they would attempt to make that case against the bank anyway.That initial confrontation led to withdrawal of the application and subsequent meetings between the bank and community groups to try to reach some compromise that would keep a branch in the neigborhood while allowing State Street to consolidate services and lessen its cost of operation.A meeting last week to iron out those differences apparently broke down though, according to Mr. Ward, because MURAG and other neighborhood representatives though State Street was ready to announce its commitment.When that did not occur, neighborhood residents and some group representatives complained that State Street was stalling.Hugh McCormack of MURAG said he left the meeting unsatisfied and felt that while Mr. Ward, who was brought into the negotiations recently, wanted to keep a branch in the Fenway, other bank officials did not.""We have a new guy (Ward) at the head, and the old guard was biting at his ankles,"" Mr. McCormack explained. Despite his dashed expectations, he agreed that State Street will agree to keep a smaller branch. ""They will stay now. There's no question.""Mr. Ward said at the next meeting on Jan. 7 that the bank will announce its commitments. ""We will have a final decision."" There ""May have been a misunderstanding that there would be a resolution at the earlier meeting,"" he said.Although the bank had originally wanted to close its Fenway branch without opening a new one, Mr. Ward indicated that some services would be retained.""I look at them as potential customers, and it's up to us to deliver services to the community,"" he said. Many area stores who had done business with the Fenway branch for years had also joined with MURAG and other groups in complaining about the possibility of being left without a commercial bank in the area."
NYS Allows Savings Bank A Branch in Buffalo Despite CRA Protests,The American Banker,"September 12, 1979, Wednesday","The approved application, for the Western New York Savings Bank, is the first new thrift branch in Buffalo in 27 years, according to NYSBD officials. The NYSBD studied the application for eight months, held an informal hearing on the matter in Buffalo last June, and sent examiners to the bank several times, they said.Gary Brody, director of the division of community reinvestment monitoring at the NYSBD, concluded: the bank has invested 90% of its assets in New York State, a high in-state percentage; the percentage of the bank's assets compared to total savings bank assets in Buffalo (11%) is comparable to the percentage of its investment in neighborhoods being complained about; the banks has been a major developer and lender in downtown projects; and the bank's relationship with community groups is ""not good.""Speaking about an allegation that Western had a minimal level of Federal Housing Administration lending in the inner city of Buffalo, Mr. Brody said that that was a ""difficult issue to deal with"" and that some groups have maintained that substantial FHA lending reflects a lack of confidence in a neighborhood.Similarly, he said the charge that the bank was unreceptive to community groups was ""problematic""divisiveness in the community group movement."" He was referring to the fact that a member of the Investment in Buffalo committee joined in protesting the application, then sent NYSBD a letter disassociating himself from the challenge. The committee is an affiliate of the New York Public Interest Research Group, Inc., a principal opponent of the application.Mr. Brody said that the application was supported by Buffalo Mayor James Griffin and by the Buffalo Chamber of Commerce.Jane rosenberg, attorney for NYPIRG in New york City, said that she was distressed at the decision. CRA, she said, requires local neighborhood investment, not just statewide investment. She said the NYSBD, in analyzing mortgage lending, was considering branch deposits held by in-state residents, but was not disclosing those statistics to community groups. NYPRIG uses total branch deposits in its analysis.A NYSBD source commented that banks, in replying to challenges, often send the NYSBD in-state and out-of-state deposit figures. He suggested it is unproductive to directly relate deposits to loans. Most challenges talk about a ""static"" deposit figure, but banks have already lent against those deposits long ago, he continued. The challenges actually have been against banks with the largest outflows.Mr. Brody said that Western, through the Home Purchasing Corp., buys abandoned buildings, rehabilitates them and sells them to first-time homebuyers.In its submission, NYPIRG said that Western declines to make direct mortgage loans in minority low-income neighborhoods of Buffalo. In the six contiguous census tracts with the highest percentage of minority concentration in east Buffalo, is said, 42 of the 56 one- to four-family mortgage loans made by Western in 1977 were made through Home.In its objection to the NYSBD, NYPIRG said that in 1977 Western made only $5.2 million in one- to four-family mortgages in the city of Buffalo, compared to $32.1 million of such lending in suburbs of Buffalo.After approving Western's application for a new branch in Buffalo, the board approved an application of State Savings & Loan Association of Jackson Heights, Queens, to open a branch in Hempstead, Nassau County.Discussing State, Mr. Brody said that while the S&L was out of the mortgage market, it made a loan to a builder located outside its CRA area (in keeping with a prior commitment it had made to him). He said that State had assured him that as soon as it obtains new funds --it has made an application to the Community Investment Fund for monies for mortgages -- it would lend inside its CRA community.Board members mentioned that many banks have gone out of the mortgage market due to a fast-rising cost of funds. Superintendent of Banks Muriel Sieber noted the ""tremendous outflow"" of deposits from thrifts.One question which surfaced is how regulators should evaluate a bank's lending performance under CRA when high interest rates have forced it out of the mortgage market.The board also approved a branch application of Erie Savings Bank, Jamestown, but the bank's request that the approval be retroactive was declined. Several board membes complained about what they called unnecessary and costly delays in approving thrift applications.Also Tuesday, the board approved applications of Banco de Vizcaya S.A. and of Banco Central S.A., both of Spain, to convert their agencies to branches."
"In First 9 Mos., CRA Exams Average as Much as 3 Days",The American Banker,"August 23, 1979, Thursday","Federal Reserve Bank examiners are taking an average of six hours on CRA exams for banks of under $10 million assets, one day to a day-and-a-half for banks of $10 million-$100 million, and two to three days for banks of $100 million-$500 million.The average time of CRA exams, extent of geocoding, and extent of visits made outside banks by examiners during CRA exams were discussed in interviews recently with Federal regulators nine months after the banking agencies issued CRA regulations.Meanwhile, community groups were interviewed about demands they have presented to Federal regulators.Geocoding is the most objective way examiners have of checking for CRA compliance, but is expensive. It basically involves recording a bank's credit extensions, applications and denials in low-and moderate-income neighborhoods on a census tract map or street map.The Fed and the Comptroller's office emerged in interviews as the agencies whose examiners are making the most use of geocoding.A senior Fed official in Washington said that he thought examiners were doing a substantial amount of geocoding at two or three Federal Reserve Banks and some geocoding at the others.Fed examiners in the New York district are geocoding on every CRA exam, said a local Fed source. Extensions and denials of home mortgage and autos loans are being geocoded, primarily for low-and moderate-income neighborhoods, he said.If examiners find questionable patterns, they will check credit card approvals and personal loans. In each exam, minimum loans being geocoded go beyond those listed on banks' Home Mortgage Disclosure Act reports, the source said.Comptroller's office examiners, in every CRA exam, are geocoding loans listed on HMDA reports as well as a sample of at least 35 accepted loans and 18 rejected loans, according to John Chipouras, director of consumer, community and fair lending examination at the Comptroller's office. Small business loans currently are geocoded only in some cases but these loans will likely be geocoded more often in the future, he said.The apparent reason for less geocoding at the FDIC and FHLBB is that the two agencies have commissioned a comprehensive study of HMDA and some geocoding matters. Results of this study are expected at the end of October.At the FDIC, geocoding has been used only to a limited extent and has been limited largely to mortgage loans, while at the FHLBB examiners are geocoding HMDA data in each CRA exam.The four agencies recently purchased updates of 1970 demographic and housing data on census tracts in Milwaukee, Buffalo, San Antonio and San Diego standard metropolitan statistical areas. A CRA subcommittee of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council is reportedly studying whether to recommend purchase of nationally updated census information, which would be provided to all examiners conducting CRA exams.A conclusion of several interviews was that this subcommittee will decide major CRA policy questions for all agencies in the future. This subcommittee, which replaced the interagency CRA task force, is concerned with maintaining consistent standards on CRA applications as it monitors and evaluates agency implementation of CRA, one regulator said.The senior Fed official said that, in checking at five reserve banks, he found that ""in many cases"" examiners had gone outside to talk with planning, housing and other city officials and, sometimes, to community groups. Only limited outside contacts were reported at the other agencies, with the FDIC finding no such visits in a check of 66 CRA exams.No agency would disclose the percentage of institutions which have received poor CRA ratings. The FHLBB commented that examiners' CRA assessments ""indicate some degree of uncertainty by many institutions as to how they can best serve the credit needs of their communities during this current period of tight money and high interest rates.""And a Comptroller's office official gave some indication of what was expected under CRA from a commercial bank: ""For a commercial bank, we'll look at whether it's making residential mortgage loans. If not, it'll have to show a very good record under other assessment factors, such as a good record in small business lending, in order to get a favorable CRA assessment.""The averages of CRA exam time do not include time spent on checking for Fair Housing and related laws, and actual exam time can be much higher, particularly for large banks. For example, the FDIC, which conducted 1,700 CRA exams from January, 1978, to January, 1979, said exams have taken as long as 195 hours.The Comptroller's office, which has conducted about 1,000 CRA exams since November, 1978, said CRA exams have taken from one to 15 days. The Comptroller's overall estimate of two working days represents a 20% increase in the time (10 working days) that examiners were spending on consumer matters prior to CRA.Citibank NA officials said that two Comptroller officials spent about three weeks conducting the bank's first CRA exam last May-June. A bank official said that ""we spent a lot of time with them"" explaining Citibank's regular banking and urban affairs programs, and that the bank had ""no complaint"" about the exam.The FHLBB said that it was spending approximately 15% of total exam time on consumer compliance matters including CRA, but that this percentage should decline as examiners gain more experience.FHLBB said that, based on 848 exams in the second quarter of 1979, the average time spent by examiners checking on CRA and the agency's nondiscrimination regulations was 7.5 working days, of which an estimated three days was spent on CRA alone. Entire exams during the second quarter took an average of 41.4 working days, said Louis V. Roy, assistant regional director at the agency.The Fed's estimate, based on 193 exam reports, does not include time spent in writing reports or in meeting with Fed officials.Regulators reported that examiners at all agencies are having difficulty checking for CRA compliance at rural institutions, largely because those institutions currently are not required to compile HMDA statements. ""Rural banks are a major problem,"" said a Comptroller official.Meanwhile, the community groups are pushing regulators to enforce agreements negotiated between lenders and the groups. They also want examiners compelled to seek information during CRA exams from the groups, real estate brokers and others located outside the banks.Related questions, which are before the CRA subcommittee, are whether to incorporate such agreements in agency application approvals, and whether to decide at the regional level those applications which have had protests withdrawn. Currently, all CRA-protested applications are being decided in Washington.The subcommittee also is considering requests from community groups for greater disclosure about banks' CRA performance. The groups have asked for release of CRA exam reports, particularly for those banks which consistently have poor CRA ratings, of exam reports without bank names or of aggregate statistics on CRA exams.However, several regulators appeared firmly opposed to releasing actual CRA exams on the groun that such a move could reduce examiners' ability to talk freely with bank management and with the agencies. Regulators at two agencies said this position is based on policy rather than legal considerations.Allen Fishbein, attorney with the Center for Community Change in Washington, said ""the regulators expect community groups to do a lot of things without the tools,"" such as release of exam reports.A Comptroller's office official said that ""we do feel the groups have a legitimate problem. They never get feedback on complaints or exams."" The mostly volunteer groups compile research and submit CRA comments but the agencies generally remain ""silent,"" the official said.Community groups said that one of the only ways they can obtain substantial information about banks' lending records is to file protests to banks' applications. And the application protest is not an option in unit banking andlimited branching states, they pointed out. They said that banks' transgressions of CRA responsibilities go unchecked except for annual CRA exams (though a FHLBB official said that substantive complaints are checked out by field personnel whenever they are filed).In addition, community groups charged the Federal regulators are not enforcing CRA vigorously. A National Peoples Action official in Chicago cited the Fed's approval about two months ago of a protested application filed by Ohio Citizens Trust Co., Toledo.The Fed said in its decision that it had obtained a commitment from Ohio Citizens that it will make increased efforts to communicate with members of its community. When NPA asked the Fed for specifics about the commitment, the Fed replied in a letter that the commitment had not been obtained in writing and that it had been obtained in a phone call between Fed and Ohio Citizens officials with an understanding that communication meant face-to-face contact, according to the NPA official. The Fed added it intended to monitor the commitment during its regular consumer compliance exam, she said.Gale Cincotta, chairperson of NPA, said that Federal regulators should ""initiate complaints"" against banks with poor lending records much more often than they have done.The agencies, for their part, seem to be striving for an impartial role in CRA enforcement. As a FHLBB official put it, the agencies are not acting as an advocate for either side and will accept ""hard information from whatever source to make a good judgment."" This impartiality may seem strange to bankers who traditionally have viewed the agencies as allies.Some community groups feel that the dialogue which the regulators expected would result through CRA has been rare, though it may be increasing. A Comptroller's office official gave some credence to this view, saying: ""We don't think banks are going out and, to the best of their ability, soliciting information as to credit needs and developing a dialogue.""He said banks have been ""reluctant"" to contact members of their local communities and have taken the position that they have a ""pretty good"" idea of what local credit needs are.Mr. Fishbein said the expected partnership between community groups and lenders on local community development ventures has not materialized.The FHLBB cited three examples of such partnership, two involving Neighborhood Housing Services units. In a third example, Union Dime Savings Bank expanded efforts with a community organization for housing rehabilitation in east Harlem after the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York helped organize a housing investment forum in Harlem.Also, regulators are accused by community groups of instituting complex, inconsistent procedures which frustrate involvement of community groups.Meantime, the subcommittee is considering other requests made by community groups at a meeting held at the Comptroller's office last June 25.The groups asked all agencies to support an extension of HMDA, which expires June 27, 1980, and support HMDA's expansion outside SMSAs.Concerning CRA statements, the groups asked that regulators make recommended-but-optional information mandatory and require statement of types of credit actually extended.The groups also asked the agencies for assurances that geocoding by examiners of bank's distribution of loans would be done as completely and uniformly as possible. And they asked that examiners check the accuracy of HMDA statements."
Credit Counseling Urged in Jersey,The American Banker,"November 7, 1979, Wednesday","The recession is coming, Gerard A. Lareau, president of the Consumer Credit Counseling Service of New York, told the conference that this will mean that more people will lose their jobs and the overtime pay they have been counting on to carry their heavier debt load.The New York counseling service, which has branches in Rochelle Park and Newark, has already seen ""a lot more people"" coming in for help, Mr. Lareau said.The six-year old New York agency is the largest of 200 not-for-profit, community sponsored credit counseling agencies in the U.S. and Canada.Mr. Lareau urged bankers, other lenders and community and business leaders to support setting up credit counseling agencies in the Camden-Cherry Hill, Atlantic City-Toms River, and Trenton-Princeton areas.Bankers have done a ""fantastic job"" in selling people on the use of credit, he said. Now consumers must be educated to use credit wisely and carefully, he stressed.James M. Davidson, chairman of the consumer credit committee of the New Jersey Bankers Association, told the conference that the facility in Bergen County is doing ""very well.""The office there was opened more than a month ago as the successor to one previously set up by the Bergen County Bankers Association.Mr. Davidson, who is vice president of National Community bank, Rutherford, told the conference that the rewards are many for consumer counseling services. ""The publicity is great"", he said, adding, ""we are doing something for the public without being forced to, and finally, it looks great on your Community Reinvestment Act statement."""

Turn to Profitability Leads Black-Owned Atlanta Bank to Step Up Push for Business,The American Banker,"May 24, 1979, Thursday","Like its larger competitors, the $45.9 million-deposit Citizens Trust suffered from depressed economic conditions in the Southeast earlier in this decade. A string of yearly losses ended in 1977 with a $167,000 net profit, compared with a $250,000 loss in 1976. Last year, net profit increased another 280% to $467.6 million.The bank's president, I. Owen Funderburg, is pleased with the improvement.""Our prospects for the future have never been better,"" he said. ""It is conceivable that our profitability (in 1979) will surpass last year's level. We are going to be more aggressive in going after new business, particularly business accounts. You're going to be hearing more about Citizens Trust.""Mr. Funderburg's optimism is backed up by figures showing demand deposits grew 30% last year to $24.3 million, savings deposits were up 15% to $17.3 million and loans increased 14% to $15.1 million.But it contrasts sharply with expressions of concerns heard a few years ago when directors and shareholders were worried about Citizen Trust's very survival.For half a century the bank was controlled by the late Lorimer D. Milton, a former school teacher. When he retired in 1971 at the age of 81, the bank was burdened with a large portfolio of problem loans, a new, larger and more expensive-than-necessary 12-story headquarters building and a backlog of paper work.Concerned that a collapse of one of Atlanta's two major minority-owned institutions -- the other being Atlanta Life Insurance Co. -- would be a heavy blow to the black community, larger, white-owned Atlanta banks quietly provided management help. Citizens & Southern National Bank, the largest in Georgia, assigned a team of its officers to Citizens Trust to take over the black Bank' management. They closed the unprofitable trust department and credit card operations.Four other Atlanta banks and the Ford Foundation bought $3 million in low interest loans to beef up the bank's capital from $900,000.Mr. Funderburg came to Citizens Trust in 1974 from Gateway National Bank, St. Louis, where he was executive vice president. Within one year the new president, a native of Monticello, Ga., realigned the bank's management and the C&S team left. Straightening out the loan portfolio was his biggest problem.""Some of the loans made were just plain poor,"" Mr. Funderburg said shortly after he arrived.The bank wrote off more than $2 million in loans which had caused its capital to erode to $2.4 million.By the end of 1977, Mr. Funderburg said, ""we could begin to see the end of the rainbow. Help came that year when the bank's landlord, the New York Life Insurance Co., allowed Citizens Trust to delay mortgage payments and when the bank took advantage of tax credits it earned from the previous years' losses.By 1978 the bank had recovered sufficiently to begin planning for future growth. Mr. Funderburg set about rebuilding the bank's capital to about $4 million, a level that would satisfy regulators. And the bank wanted to expand beyond its current three branches. The president and board agreed Citizens Trust earnings improvement made a $1 million stock sale feasible.The stock sale is one of Mr. Funderburg's current projects.In addition, he feels ""further improvement in our loan-to-deposit ratio would be in the best interest of both our bank and the community we serve."" Citizens Trust's loans total about 37% of its deposits compared with an industrywide average of 60%.Most of the bank's funds are invested in government securities and short-term commercial paper.Mr. Funderburg also plans to hire a business development officer to establish contacts outside the black community. ""Our philosophy now is not only to try to attract resources from the community to reinvest in the community, but to go outside to attract funds,"" he said. Currently, about $200,000 in loans are to white-controlled businesses, mostly, large national corporations which keep deposits balances at Citizens Trust.Most of the bank's loans are to individuals because ""the black community doesn't have a large number of commercial establishments,"" Mr. Funderburg explained.""It is basically a wage-earning community. The people need homes so we lend mortgage money. They have to maintain their homes so we make home improvement loans. They have to get to work so we make auto loans.""Black-owned institutions such as banks and insurance companies cannot solve all of the black community's problems, he said. ""The experience of the last 15 or 20 years has shown that the problems inherent in a disadvantaged community go beyond the capacity of any one institution, whether black or white, to deal with.""For example, the experience of the Economic Opportunity Loan Program of the Small Business Administration shows that just an infusion of money doesn't overcome all these difficulties. The loss experience of this program has been heavier than normal bank lending,"" he said.One of Mr. Funderburg's major criticisms of the program's eight-year loans is that the term shows the SBA does not understand the community's real problems.""If you put a person in business with a loan, instead of with his or her own money, the first thing that person has to worry about is generating the cash to begin making loan repayments,"" he said. ""If you gave the person a longer time to repay, the success experience would be higher."""
"CRA Conditions Set for Two S&L Branches; Texas Bank Allowed to Leave Minority Site;
Lending at Issue",The American Banker,"June 22, 1979, Friday","At issue was First Federal Savings & Loan Association of Toledo's compliance with FHLBB antidiscrimination regulations and the Community Reinvestment Act, which is intended to evaluate a financial institution's record in providing community credit needs.The FHLBB did not find that the Toledo S&L violated any of these regulations, but did suggest that its lending record could be improved.Among the conditions imposed by the FHLBB was the requirement that the S&L eliminate, for certain parts of the community, a general policy of lending only to its own customers during tight money periods. An FHLBB official said the S&L defined a customer as a person with a savings record at the association for six months, or less than six months if the individual came to the areas as the result of a job transfer.The FHLBB said that while it had no proof that this practice was discriminatory, it favored elimination of the ""customer only"" policy for areas of Toledo with low- and moderate-income residents.The agency said it would investigate whether the S&L's ""customer only"" policy had discriminatory effects. The investigation also would analyze the S&L's decision to require 10% down payments on loans, a change from a previous policy of acceptting 5% down payments.The S&L's applications had been protested by the Greater Toledo Housing Coalition on grounds that the association had discriminated on the basis of the age and location of!dwellings in areas populated predominantly by minorities and families headed by women, FHLBB officials said.The FHLBB action Thursday authorized First Federal of Toledo to establish branches in Toledo and Oregon, Ohio, provided the S&L:* Eliminated its ""customer only"" lending policy in the census tracts defined in the protest by the Toledo community group, as well as other areas now getting Federal housing assistance. The ""customer only"" policy could remain in effect elsewhere.* Committed itself to making home improvement loans, which the S&L recently began on a voluntary basis.* Agreed to meet with community groups at least semi-annually.* More clearly delineated its lending territory in its Community Reinvestment Act statement.* Clarified in the CRA statement its intentions to meet the credit needs of low and moderate income residents of its lending territory.* Specified efforts to affirmatively market the lending programs to the community.Donald A. Baker, president of First Federal of Toledo, said Thursday he would not comment on the FHLBB action until he obtained the various conditions in writing from the agency.Much of the discussion during the long debate between FHLBB members and staff dealt with the legality and equity of ""customer only"" policies.Board member Anita Miller and Sandra Rosenblith, director of the legal division of the FHLBB office of community investment, asked about the possibility of denying the First Federal application because of the ""customer only"" practice.However, FHLBB general counsel Milan G. Miskovsky cautioned that there had been no factual proof that the policy was discriminatory and therefore no legal basis for challenging its existence.Mrs. Miller responded that she was unhappy and upset with the kind of documentation provided by the S&L which she said was not adequate. She added that ""I cannot approve a conditional approval where we know there is a suspicion this policy will undermine the very conditions we agree to.""FHLBB chairman Robert H. McKinney said the ""customer only"" policy was used by many S&L's and that he was ""quite concerned about it.""After an agreement to investigate the effects of the S&L's underwriting policies, Mrs. Miller and Mr. McKinney voted their conditional approval of the Toledo S&L's applications.In other action Thursday, the FHLBB approved applications from four S&L's to convert from mutual to stock form. Converting to Federal stock charters will be the Bayamon Federal S&L in Puerto Rico and the First Federal S&L of Roanoke, Va. Converting to state-chartered stock form will be Beverly Hills Federal S&L in California and the Land of Lincoln Federal in Berwyn, Ill."
Dime Savings Bid For Merger Hit,The American Banker,"April 26, 1979, Thursday","At an informal, four-hour meeting sponsored by the FDIC and New York State Banking Department, Harry W. Albright Jr., Dime president, rejected community groups' contention that his institution was not meeting mortgage credit needs of Brooklyn, the thrift's primary market.The Dime applied for permission to merge with the Mechanics Exchange Savings Bank, Albany.The FDIC earlier this week rejected a branch application of the $1.5 billion-deposit Greater New York Savings Bank, its first decision on a CRA-protested application.The FDIC has held CRA community meetings before, but Tuesday's meeting was the first sponsored by both the FDIC and the State Banking Department, which had suggested the joint format to avoid duplication of effort.Bernard McKeon, regional director of the FDIC, and Muriel F. Siebert, Superintendent of Banks in New York, listened to Mr. Albright's statement and then to one community group representative after another as they came to the front of the room to present well-prepared statements and statistics to back their contention that the Dime does not meet community credit needs.Mr. Albright reiterated a complaint that financial institutions' return on mortgage loans, at 9.5%, is still too low compared to the cost of funds to enable them to profitably expand their portfolios.He cited statistics showing new mortgages loans in Brooklyn rose 14.5% or $34.8 million during 1978 despite a $116 million deposit outflow the same year. The thrift's portfolio of outstanding mortgage loans in all five New York City boroughs totaled $443 million as of September, 1978, up from $404 million a year earlier, he said.Jane Rosenberg, an attorney for the New York Public Interest Research Group, a consumer organization active in pursuing implementation of CRA, also used statistics to show Dime Brooklyn deposits increased $170 million in 1977 while new mortgages totaled $13 million in mortages the same year. In Nassau County, Long Island, she said, deposits increased only $16 million while new mortgages there totaled $20 million. The statistics show, she contended, that the Dime is using its suburban operations as ""a siphon"" for funds deposited in Brooklyn.Ms. Rosenberg said the Dime's proposed acquisition of two savings and loan associations in suburban Nassau and Westchester counties would provide the savings bank with a tool through which to channel additional mortgage funds out of New York City. The DiMe has applied to acquire First Federal Savings & Loan Association in Port Washington, N.Y. on Long Island, and Westchester County Savings & Loan Association, Ossining.To explain the discrepancy in deposit flow estimates, J. W. Sapanski, executive vice president of the Dime, said the community group based its Brooklyn estimate on deposits made at Brooklyn branches, while the thirft tallied deposits made by Brooklyn residents at all Dime branches.Mr. Albright cited the increased cost of funds caused by savings instruments such as six-month money market certificates and demands by depositors for a higher return on their savings as factors making mortgages unprofitable. He said, ""No bank can lend money at lower rates than it pays its depositors for very long.""Mutual officials were met with stony silence at the end of their presentations, while each community speaker received polite applause from the assembly, many of whom took pains to let the regulators know they had taken the afternoon off to be there.Doris Jeffrey, a resident of northeast Brooklyn, said the size of the $4.1 billion-deposit Dime made it a trend-setter among thrifts in Brooklyn. Using a phrase from the mutual's current advertising theme, she said, ""Not only the road to riches starts at the Dime, mortgage policy starts there too. And sometimes comes to a dead end there.""Louder applause and cheers greeted Tim O'Hanlon from South Brooklyn when he told the crowd that the FDIC had rejected a branch bid by the $1.5 billion-deposit Greater New York Savings Bank.An FDIC investigation under CRA found the mutual was not adequately meeting mortgage demand in Brooklyn in light of its deposit inflows there."
Upstate New York Bank Pursues 100% Marketing,The American Banker,"June 18, 1979, Monday","How did this program develop and how successful is it?Community State Bank, a commercial bank serving New York State's Capital District (Albany, Schenectady, Troy), acquired new leadership in 1976 in the person of Gerald B. Fitzgerald, president, and the management team he recruited.Under his direction, the present day marketing philosophy of the bank has been developed. In a nutshell, this philosophy is expressed in our bank's theme, ""banking as it should be."" It should be pointed out that this theme applies both to customers and to bank personnel.To update the level of professionalism throughtout our bank, and assure prompt, professional and courteous service to all customers, education and communications have been substantially improved. At a time when many larger banks were trimming their employees education benefits, Community State Bank held firm to its budget commitments for this purpose.
The MarketIn the market we serve, we are faced with intense competition, not only from locally based commercial and savings banks, but also from credit unions and branches of New York City ""giants."" The latter include Chase Manhattan, Citibank, Bankers Trust, Manufacturers Hanover, Chemical and Marine Midland. Also, the three largest locally-headquarted banks have assets in excess of $2.5 billion and a total of 91 offices. In addition to these and dozens of other banks, there are 54 credit unions and three Federal savings and loan associations.In this financial mix, Community State Bank takes its place under the heading of ""small banks."" Our offices number eight; our assets total $79,000,000. However, we are represented in strategic market areas. And we have something that few, if any of the others have -- 100% staff participation in the marketing effort.To set a benchmark for our marketing budget, we use an industry rule of thumb --the inflationary squeeze takes its toll, as it does with so many smaller, retail-oriented banks, we still maintain a minimum budget earmarked for internal programs -- particularly education and training.
Small Bank ProgramsSmall is beautiful. Because of the modest size of our bank, we have been successful in offering personalized service, not only to the general public but to special groups, such as doctors and lawyers. In developing and implementing programs, we can proceed with maximum speed without going through committees. By moving quickly, Community State Bank has, in many instances, been able to score a ""first"" over the competition.
Bank Service InnovationsFor example, in early 1976, Community State Bank introduced the graduated payment mortgage (GPM) plan, and achieved widespread publicity including an item in the Wall Street Journal and inquiries from as far away as San Francisco and Hawaii. The plan, among the first of its kind anywhere in the country, provided for a mortgage loan with scaled down payments for the first several years and compensating installments in later years.Our rationale was that this type of mortgage payment schedule would favor young marrieds who wished to buy a home but were saddled with the many expenses of establishing a household. The success and popularity of the GPM plan confirmed this theory.Again, our bank scored with a credit plan for your adults. Called the CredAbility TM Account, it consisted of a free checking account with cash reserve line of credit. Once an applicant qualified for credit, he or she could borrow up to $500 without a cosigner.The CredAbility Account offered young people in our market area, for the first time, an opportunity to establish their credit, beginning at age 18. Like the GPM, this program proved to be a popular one. Although limited in terms of account numbers, the CredAbility Account has become a continuing factor in introducing your people to the many other services of Community State Bank, and this we consider its chief advantage.Being alert and responsive to community needs has also led to our 60-Plus Club, which provides service-charge-free checking to retirees and pensioners along with direct deposit and other services.In 1978, we implemented a new savings plan under provisions of New York State's unique Parent's and Student's Savings Plan (PASS). This plan is designed to help middle income parents come to grips with the steadily increasing costs of higher education. Under PASS, parents can establish a fund to be used solely for the cost of tuition and other specified expenses incurred in sending their children or other dependents to college. The incentive is a New York income tax deduction. Once more, our bank was the first in the Capital District, and one of the first in the state, to offer the PASS Plan to the public.
Internal ProgramsWhere do our marketing ideas come from? Sometimes from the top, sometimes from lower echelon employees, sometimes from branch office managers. We encourage all personnel to participate in the marketing process by submitting their thoughts and opinions regarding advertising, promotion and publicity.In this way, we integrate marketing with every other facet of bank operations, and all personnel contributed to the overall success.Our management does not set policy in a vacuum. Specific times are devoted to give-and-take sessions which provide both information for employees and feedback for management. Branch input is factored into decisions on club premiums, types of ads, lobby exhibits, promotions, etc. The people who are in daily contact with our customers are our most valuable source of information about customer needs and wants.Typical of Community State Bank internal programs was the new account competition we held last fall for our bank employees. Called ""Sing-Ups '78"", it was intended to build our deposit base over a three-month period.Cash prizes were offered on the basis of total amount of deposits of all accounts opened upon referral from a contestant.To be eligible for a prize, an employee had to refer a minimum of $2,500 in deposits. Types of accounts included demand deposit, regular savings, time savings, savings certificates, Christmas and Chanukah Clubs and safe deposit boxes. The contest was eminently successful, generating over $1 million in new deposits over the three-month period.
Advertising and Publicity""Banking as it should be"" is advertised in newspapers in Albany, Schenectady and Troy, and broadcast on radio and TV in these markets. Though small, Community State Bank makes a sizeable dent in public awareness through strategic budgeting and shrewd media buys for maximum impact.Working with Devey, Thompson & Vignola, our advertising agency, we have established the position of a personal service bank that is consumer oriented. Our public profile is highly professional, despite a limited budget.For instance, to promote our CredAbility Account, we looked for a young actor with whom our young audience could empathize. We found Steve Gutenberg, a student at State University at Albany, who had credits for network TV and national advertising. His performance in our commercial went a long way toward assuring its success, and we borrowed a TV frame to illustrate the supporting newspaper ad. The result was an outstanding campaign that not only brought in customers but also cast our bank in a very favorable light.Recently, when a new network TV show, starring Steve Gutenberg, made its debut, local reviewers remembered his role in our CredAbility commercial and provided us with some unexpected publicity in the local media.We regularly make the most of publicity, with an ongoing program of newsworthy information concerning personnel changes, new services, seminars conducted for businessmen and a variety of other happenings. Material flows in constantly from our employees.The business seminars mentioned above are illustrative of our public relations activities at Community State Bank.They have been set up to disseminate information that small businessmen would have a difficult time finding elsewhere. We, as bankers, together with the experts we can call upon in the community, are well equipped to offer financial expertise to these entrepreneurs. The seminars are genuinely helpful, and promote good will and new business, as well as providing us with public relations ammunition.After three years of ""banking as it should be,"" Community State Bank has assessed the value of its ""100% MARKETING"" approach, and feels that the basic concept is well worth pursuing. The bank's assets have nearly doubled during this ongoing program. Our goal of controlled growth is progressing satisfactorily."
Urban Affairs Adds 2 New Dimension to Mortgage Lending,The American Banker,"October 15, 1979, Monday","A few typical questions regularly encountered by urban mortgage lenders illustrate the dilemma. A racially mixed neighborhood experiences increased sales of small homes at apparently inflated prices: is it ""blockbusting"" or ""brownstoning?"" A number of multiple dwellings are abandoned by owners: is this a signal to dump the local mortgage portfolio or to expand investment while a community group forces out the new owners who had threatened an otherwise stable community? The city designates an area for an infusion of government funds: will the designation restore local confidence, drive out the middle class, or simply never come to fruition? A group of tenants organizes and takes over a building which requires upgrading: is this a sound investment? An area is labelled ""transitional"": is it going up or down?Increasingly, the regulatory agencies, public officials and the media are watching every move that institutional lenders make. In many cases, the private sector is being held accountable for providing answers to questions that require prophetic insight. Since these new demands in urban lending require an expertise and capacity that falls outside the traditional mortgage, appraisal, marketing or public relations functions of most lending institutions, there has developed a general movement toward establishing a separate urban affairs department.While institutions may structure or label such a department in various ways, the universal goal is to provide within a bank's basic structure the capacity to assess and respond to the changing needs of individual urban neighborhoods. This is particularly vital in those areas where the physical housing stock or general economic conditions may not support conventional mortgage lending activities or in cases where conventional underwriting or credit criteria cannot be fairly applied to proposed mortgagors.The fact that urban affairs is a major addition to the administrative structure of lending institutions indicates the depth and significance of the urban investment issue in the banking community. Yet, in many cases, institutions may be hiring urban affairs personnel in response to immediate political pressures and without careful consideration of the meeting of this function in terms of the fundamental commitment to a change in the institutions's approach to neighborhoods and its methods of doing business there. In this context, the approach taken by Anchor Savings Bank may provide some useful guidelines for urban lenders throughout the country who are struggling with or will ultimately face this issue.Based in Brooklyn, New York, where much of the ""anti-redlining"" activity that resulted in the Community Reinvestment Act had its genesis, Anchor Savings Bank was among the first institutions to face a challenge to a 1977 merger application based on its urban mortgage lending. Ironically, while fate dictated Anchor's pioneering role as a test case in the anti-redlining movement, this bank was in a better position than most to meet the challenge. The bank's home office is in a Brooklyn community called Sunset Park, which suffered significant evidence of urban blight during the 1960s. As Anchor's extensive, local mortgage portfolio was increasingly threatened, the bank became a prime mover in an emerging neighborhood preservation program.The bank used its personnel to explore government-assisted housing rehabilitation programs and to identify responsible neighborhood groups who could assist in their implementation. Long-time relationships with civic, business and church organizations in the neighborhood were expanded to include the influx of a young, Puerto Rican population, providing the basis for a unified and comprehensive approach to neighborhood revitalization.Over the course of five years, Anchor assisted in establishing a not-for-profit housing rehabilitation program and in securing government-assisted programs to support more than $30 million in residential rehabilitation and new construction activities. The direct involvement of the bank's senior officers and mortgage department provided a level of institutional commitment and expertise that enabled Anchor to understand and respond effectively to the credit needs of Sunset Park during a decade when other private institutions and government agencies had effectively written off the community as another inevitable slum.The challenge of understanding the day to day dynamics of the community surrounding Anchor's home office involved a time-consuming and labor intensive process. A decade of rapid expansion had brought Anchor into 12 other neighborhoods scattered around New York City, each with its own problems, needs and expectations. The bank was not prepared to close its eyes to the complex demands of these neighborhoods, especially in view of the tremendous success of its early efforts in Sunset Park and the mandate of the Community Reinvestment Act. However, senior officers and the mortgage department were no longer able to keep up with the requirements of an effective relationship in so many diverse neighborhoods. After careful consideration, the bank determined to formalize its commitment to urban investment and established a department of urban affairs in March of 1979.The urban affairs department is structured as an arm of the president's office, separate and distinct from either the mortgage or the public relations functions. Its primary responsibilities include:To develop a complete and continually updated profile of the communities served by Anchor Savings Bank, based on input from primary sources within the neighborhood and supportive data from government agencies and elected officials;To identify and establish communication with responsible preservation and community development programs, particularly, those involved in house-related activities, providing these groups with a point of access within the bank and giving the institution a local source of information, feedback and referral;To educate neighborhood groups as to the possibilities and, importantly, the limitations on the bank's role in a given neighborhood;To put the bank's technical expertise and the weight of its reputation and influence behind responsible neighborhood improvement efforts, working as an advocate for the allocation of public and private resources or for legislation needed to solve local problems;To develop a program that continually educates and sensitizes personnel in departments of the bank to the problems, priorities and opportunities in the neighborhoods it serves; andTo seek out creative opportunities for responsible urban investment, channeling proposals into the bank's mortgage department and helping to secure additional public or other private support when a project does not meet the bank's conventional lending criteria.Anchor's urban affairs program has taken different forms in response to the needs of particular communities. In the Northwest Bronx, where the concentration of economic and social problems dwarf the resources of local banks, Anchor is taking the lead in securing designation of its service area as a national pilot program of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. This designation would provide more liberalized appraisal and mortgage credit underwriting standards for government insured and co-insured mortgages under rehabilitation and financing programs which currently preclude properties in these areas. In the case of the stable Brooklyn neighborhood of Bay Ridge, which is experiencing early signs of deterioration in a few of its otherwise solid multiple dwellings, Anchor is working with the Community Board to conduct a housing survey and providing the technical skills necessary to analyze and suggest the appropriate treatment for potential problem priorities. Bank staff have actually brought city housing officials on their first tour of Bay Ridge to assure that, if the need for government assistance should be required, the appropriate support will be readily forthcoming.The constructive, activist approach which Anchor has taken to the challenge of responsible urban investment contrasts markedly with the traditional perception of thrift institutions as aloof and relatively passive. Anchor has recognized that the ""age of consumerism"" requires that banking institutions be directly involved in the mainstream of community life. Such involvement must be approached with great care, since any ""politicization"" of the mortgage lending process can spell disaster if it brings pressure on a bank to make unsound investments. To maintain the integrity of the mortgage lending operation, it is essential that appropriate ""checks and balances"" within an institution are preserved and that technical underwriting and appraisal personnel are insulated from direct exposure to political and community pressure. As an institution's key point of success and outreach, the urban affairs department represents a buffer between community interests and the bank's professional investment staff. This structure enables senior management and the governing board to make investment decisions that reflect specific community priorities as well as the fiduciary responsibility of the bank. Assuming that the urban affairs function is effectively carried out, it provides the bank with an internal capacity to evaluate prospective investments on the basis of more complete and comprehensive data, and ultimately to defend its investment decisions on the basis of a fully rounded approach to urban lending. While this approach may not completely resolve the difficult questions encountered in urban mortgage lending, it does provide the basis for more enlightened investment activity and a more explicit definition of the common interests of banking institutions and the neighborhoods they serve. The result should be a cooperative relationship which, coupled with support from local, state and Federal government, represents the most promising path toward the revitalization of America's urban centers."
Judges Hit Mo. Group's Challenge of Fed-Approved Merger,The American Banker,"October 24, 1979, Wednesday","In an oral hearing on the suit in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, the three-judge panel repeatedly asked Giradeau A. Spann, attorney for the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, to justify the group's challenge of the merger of Commerce Bancshares, Inc., Kansas City, with Manchester Financial Corp., St. Louis.The group contends that the Fed illegally disregarded lending performance standards for BHC applications estabished under the Community Reinvestment Act.It is asking that the court send the approval back to the Board and order the agency to make specific lending guidelines a condition for another approval.One of the judges, Malcolm R. Wilkey, told the attorney that the group should ""cheer"" the merger because the top management of the Kansas City company had a better record of community lending than the St. Louis cocern it acquired.Gerhard A. Gesell, a district court judge siting on the appeals panel, said, ""You lost this case when you lost your stay (request to delay the transaction last year). It's too late to start tampering.""Judge Carl McGowan asked Mr. Spann several times exactly what actions his group wanted the court to take and whether it was in the court's power to take them. He stopped his questioning, however, when the attorney said ACORN was not seeking that the ruling be declared invalid, but wanted Commerce Bancshares to make specific lending commitments as a condition to the merger.Among those commitments, the group suggested that the BHC make mortgage loans with a 5% downpayment if the loan is secured and 10% if it is unsecured. It also recommended that the mortgages have a 30-year maturity.Judge Wilkey called such terms ""pretty rigid"" and said they would limit the BHC's flexibility in reacting to market conditions.""You know it might be a very bad banking practice to impose these rigid requirements,"" he said, ""because once the court imposes them on the people involved, they are stuck with them.""James V. Mattingly Jr., the Fed's attorney, told the court that Commerce Banchsares had made five general community lending commitments to the agency as a condition to the merger. Those commitments included a program to encourage mortgage applicants in a 64-block area of St. Louis to apply for loans, newspaper and other advertisements, a promise to keep experienced lending officers at the Manchester offices and a promise to continue to meet with community groups.Mr. Mattingly said ACORN's recommendations were ""tantamount to the allocation of credit"" and that the Board had no authority under the CRA to demand that.He also reviewed Manchester Financial's record in participating in community development projects in St. Louis.While Mr. Spann was concluding his arguments calling the present commitments ""cosmetic,"" Judge Gesell interrupted him. ""Mr. Mattingly is saying that this bank has been in the area trying to create jobs,"" the judge said.The group filed its challenge last September.In its June 16, 1978, ruling, the Fed siad the past lending records of both BHCs were sufficient to satisfy the Bank Holding Company Act's requirements and that it would have been premature to apply the CRA to the application because the law did not become effective until the following November."
Fin. Institutions Differ on CRA Statements,The American Banker,"March 15, 1979, Thursday","South Shore went well beyond CRA requirements. In a 14-page, single-spaced CRA statement, South Shore explained management's lending philosophy, assessed unmet credit needs, and revealed such innovative practices as beginning a speaking tour at block association meetings to encourage home improvement borrowing.North Side's CRA statement consisted of four pages, two of which were maps and one of which was the text of the CRA notice. The other page simply stated: ""The following services are being offered by North Side Savings Bank for your convenience: residential mortgage loans for 1-4-family units; home improvement loans; personal savings loans (and) student loans.""These statements, which had to be approved by financial institutions' boards by Feb. 4, are extremes in an American Banker informal survey of 36 CRA statements from commercial banks, savings banks, and savings and loan associations of varied sizes and geographic regions.Of the 36, all but a handful provided the required delineation and map of local community, list of principal types of credit offered, and copy of the CRA notice. However, many banks failed to provide information which regulators encouraged lenders to include, or gave that information in general rather than specific terms.About half discussed the encouraged-but-optional area of how they are helping meet community credit needs, about 16 discussed how they are attempting to ascertain those needs, and eight provided a periodic report on their record of helping meet those needs.Gale Cincotta, chairperson of National People's Action, a Chicago-based group which has looked at about 40 CRA statements, said the statements seemed to be ""business as usual"" instead of saying ""under CRA we will be doing something different.""Bankers perceived different possibilities in the CRA statement. For example, South Shore Bank used the statement requirement to search for ways to encourage development in the South Shore area of Chicago beyond what the bank is doing now, a bank official said. There are bottom-line benefits to this approach: a good image helps draw new deposits as well as noneconomic support for the bank's work, she noted.In a section about unmet credit needs, South Shore examined loan requests which it could not approve, as well as loans needed but not requested. It concluded that it has not adequately communicated its interest in making loans and that it has not dispelled the notion it is unwilling to make loans. The bank learned, in the course of preparing the statement, that it needs to find ways to collect information about unmet credit needs, the official said.Sal Tallarico, assistant vice president and CRA officer at North Side, when asked why the bank did not provide any of the requested but optional information, said that the statement met the requirements. Mr. Tallarico said that the bank's law firm had outlined the format and added the bank had to ""get it out"" in order to comply on time.He said he was thinking of using different colors to better highlight the CRA notice and perhaps sentences instead of the list of credit services, but said he did not expect any major change in content.Meanwhile on the West Coast, Jerry E. Weeks, senior vice president of the $6.6 billion-deposit Great Western Savings and Loan Association, Beverly Hills, Calif., said that that S&L found the statement ""a good opportunity"" to tell the public and employees about its efforts to encourage home ownership in mortgage-deficient neighborhoods -- about which often it had said little in the past. The S&L, second largest in the nation, sells its 19-page state-ment for $2, though it costs $5 to prepare, largely for maps, he said.Most of the CRA statements appear to be free to the public. Some banks charge $1 or $2 for mailing and reproduction costs. But the $8.3 billion-deposit Home Savings & Loan Association, Los Angeles, largest S&L in the country, charges $11.80 for a 57-page statement for the Los Angeles area -- and $31.30 for a Sacramento statement.Some institutions used their CRA statements to marketing advantage. The $49.5 billion-deposit Chase Manhattan Bank NA and $32 billion-deposit Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., both New York, and $4.1 billion-deposit Dime Savings Bank of New York, Brooklyn, but their statements in brochure form for ready distribution to the public. The $719.1 million-deposit Carteret Savings & Loan Association, Newark, N.J., and the $152.9 million-deposit Glens Falls (N.Y.) National Bank and Trust Co. (not surveyed), prepared press releases about their statement.Three nonprofit community organizations which had made preliminary, informal reviews of CRA statements had generally negative reactions to them.Allen Fishbein, staff attorney at the Center for Community Change, Washington, said that the overwhelming majority of about 20 statements from commercial banks and S&Ls in the Washington area showed ""technical compliance but little else."" He said that community groups had expected dialogue with banks during the start-up phase for CRA statements but that banks made very little effort in their statements to reflect communication with community groups.Mr. Fishbein said that the best CRA statement he had seen, and the only one which referred to a serious displacement problem in Washington, was prepared by the $804.6 million-deposit Perpetual Federal Savings and Loan Association, Washington (not surveyed). Displacement refers to low-and moderate-income persons, including senior citizens, who are priced out of the rental market in rehabilitated neighborhoods.Perpetual said it had helped families purchase and renovate their homes and avoid displacement. It added: ""Innovative approaches to the financing of the conversion of multifamily rental properties to low-and moderate-income cooperatives have allowed Perpetual to offer sound mortgage loans to established tenant groups.""Mr. Fishbein said that the statements generally did not gerrymander out low-income areas, but said most did not mention that a list of underwriting standards was available and most did not invite comments on the statements.Mrs. Cincotta said that community groups view CRA as a tool for reinvestment, while banks see it only as a statute. The statements do not meet community groups' ""expectations of the law,"" she declared.Mrs. Cincotta suggested that community groups may focus their attention on regulatory agencies. NPA, after reviewing more statements, will contact the regulators ""in an ongoing process,"" she said. ""Regulators will get a black eye if they don't do something,"" she added, predicting the regulators would receive many challenges to applications.In this newspaper's survey, the relatively few institutions which specifically described their efforts to meet credit needs revealed innovative practices. For example, South Shore Bank said it started an internal Neighborhood Development Center which services neighborhoods which have little credit demand -- but apparent credit need.South Shore considers some of its loans to be development loans -- loans which do not meet ordinary criteria and which require more work than normal to determine ability to repay, a bank official said. Many of its development loans are for small businesses, multifamily rehabilitation, and single-family mortgages, she said.The bank said in its statement that its development loans last year totaled $6.3 million -- a 53% increase over the previous year. The official said that the bank's ratio of losses and delinquencies on development loans was lower than its overall average, which is comparable to the industry average. South Shore plans a 31% increase in development loans this year.South Shore's statement noted the bank has spent more funds and staff on small business lending than any other neighborhood lending area -- though the percentage of applications approved on small business loan requests was only 20% in 1977 and 1978. A South Shore consultant works with local merchants on merchandising, facade rehabilitation, inventory control and accounting systems, the statement showed.In another approach, the $1.2 billion-deposit Georgia Federal Savings and Loan Association, Atlanta, said it is developing prepurchase home counseling for low-and moderate-income prospective borrowers. It will provide guidance in terminology, closing and other areas. Counseling will be on a one-on-one basis by a loan officer at some branches and, ""where there is adequate and genuine demand,"" at group educational sessions.The Atlanta S&L also designated two of its appraisers as Atlanta urban specialists and gave them responsibility for making appraisals in the inner city. They are to make inspections for rehabilitation loans and inform the S&L of inadequate public services.Meanwhile, Great Western is one of several S&Ls funding home loan counseling centers for inner-city residents who want advice about mortgage or home improvement loans. S&L personnel staff seven storefront centers in Los Angeles and other areas. Qualified residents are encouraged to submit applications, which are referred to participating S&Ls.In addition, a Great Western grant largely financed a Senior Citizen Housing Assistance Center which opened last September in Venice, Calif., and provides a clearing house and counseling service to the elderly.Meanwhile, the $1.9 billion-deposit First Federal Savings and Loan Association, Miami, observed in its CRA statement that ""sensitive loan administration policies are equally as important as sensitive appraisal and underwriting practices."" It was the mortgagee of 57 units in a condominium occupied by Cuban-americans when the condominium association went bankrupt. By meeting with the owners and providing guidance in Spanish, First Federal was able to turn the situation around, the S&L said.Numerous institutions said they helped meet credit needs by participating in mortgage review funds, the Community Preservation Corp. (a New York City group sponsoring subsidized housing in transitional areas), and the Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corp. Some said they helped meet immediate cash needs of New York City during the city's 1975 financial crisis, while others mentioned their holdings of securities of city and state agencies.On the subject of ascertaining credit needs, Carteret S&L said it sent questionnaires to 48 organizations, including neighborhood improvement groups and quasigovernmental agencies across New Jersey. Twenty-nine per cent of the organizations responded, describing home improvement loans and mortgages for one-to four-family homes as the most important local credit needs.South Shore said it helps ascertain credit needs through its resident advisory board, a 19-member group representing different neighborhoods.Institutions commenting on this area, as they were encouraged to do, appeared to suggest that credit needs were made evident by the loan requests brought to the bank's loan officers from the community; there was little mention of going out to the community to measure loan demand.Among a few banks providing a record of meeting credit needs, the $4.6 billion-deposit Bowery Savings Bank, New York, said in its statement that in New York City-Long Island last year it closed 902 one-to-four-family loans worth $34.3 million, 20 multifamily loans with $17.4 million, 18 primarily commercial and industrial loans worth $68.9 million, and home improvement loans worth $6.7 million.Data about such recent mortgage lending normally are not available from New York City institutions. Bowery's data also show that last year it made more new one-to-four-family loans in Long Island than it did in New York City.The $5.3 billion-deposit Philadelphia Saving Fund Society, largest savings bank in the country, disclosed in its CRA statement -- covering Philadelphia and six counties -- that last year it originated or purchased from other lenders 4,588 mortgage loans worth $177.5 million. These included 302 loans worth $3.4 million PSFS made as a participant in the Philadelpia Mortgage Plan, which helps moderate-income families buy homes in older neighborhoods.Returning to the required community delineation, circles representing communities tended to be drawn around branches, with larger banks tending to have larger communities.The three largest New York City banks --Chase Manhattan and Manufacturers Hanover -- said their community was New York City plus some suburban areas. Their upstate banking subsidiaries were said to have had their own CRA statements.Entire states were the community of the $76.7 billion-deposit Bank of America NT&SA, San Francisco; $5.1 billion-deposit Seattle-First National Bank, and $1.2 billion-deposit City Federal Savings and Loan Association, Elizabeth, N.J.The $28.6 billion-deposit Morgan Guaranty Trust Co., New York, said its community consists of two primarily commercial, nonresidential ideas: one, a mile long and including its head office on Wall St.; and the other about a mile in diameter and including its four midtown Manhattan branches.The $1.1 billion-deposit United States Trust Co., New York, in a one-and-a-half page statement, said its community is south of Chambers St., Manhattan, an approximately mile-long area including its only domestic commercial banking office, located on Wall St.Among savingsbanks, the Bowery defined its community as New York City and much of Long Island while the Dime said its community consists of Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island, and parts of Manhattan and Long Island.An important CRA test case involves a branch application by the Greater New York Savings Bank, Brooklyn. The bank suspended action on its application until the end of April after it failed to receive the normal approval from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. in January.The $1.5 billion-deposit bank, which has since liberalized its mortgage lending terms, delineated one of its communities around two branches in Park Slope, Brooklyn, an area measuring roughly two miles by half a mile.A bank serving a rural population -- the $26.3 million-deposit Liberty Trust and Savings Bank, Durant, Iowa -- drew a community extending 5.5 miles around Durant, plus a nearby corporate city.A long list of available types of credit, including residential mortgage loans, was part of virtually every CRA statement. Some had restrictions on mortgage loans: the $2 billion-deposit Riggs National Bank, Washington, said they were usually restricted to customers and $892 million-deposit East New York Savings Bank, Brooklyn, said conventional mortgage borrowers must have been depositors for at least one year.Among wholesale banks, Morgan said it makes residential mortgage and condominium mortgage loans to individuals while U.S. Trust said it does not seek home mortgage or other loans of the retail type.The minority-owned $65.2 million-deposit Freedon National Bank of New York did not include residential mortgage loans in its list of available credits. A Freedom official said the bank stopped making mortgage loans about seven years ago following heavy losses, particularly on multifamily buildings abandoned by landlords following the 1973 oil price increase.Some bank branches did not have CRA statements available -- though they have been required since Feb. 4 by Federal banking regulators -- and some have posted the CRA notice in remote areas. On the other hand, some banks have sent regulators copies of their CRA statements, an action which is not required."
1st Penn Speakers Bureau Widens Scope,The American Banker,"October 10, 1979, Wednesday","The bureau, according to Patricia Schweiker of the bank's staff, provides ""free advertising and increased awareness of the various services and products First Pennsylvania offers.""It enhances First Pennsylvania's image and the reputation and self-confidence of our offices.""Mrs. Schweiker says it also helps the community by furnishing information and assistance on banking and other financial matters.The list of speakers include several executive vice presidents, such as Leslie Butler, in operations, and Bertram Zumeta, the company's economist, and several senior vice presidents, including Elmer Young, corporate responsibility, and Stephen Garfinkel, money markets, as well as officers at all levels of management.Branch managers and assistant managers are also active in the bureau.The speakers bureau, which has been in operation several years, had been getting most gequests from schools and community organizations.However, after publication of a new brochure, ""Figures of Speech,"" which was mailed to professional and trade groups as well as local business magazines and community newspapers requests have become ""more sophisticated and technical,"" according to Mrs. Schweiker.The bank has received inquiries from trade groups and professional organizations, for speakers to address sales meetings, conventions and conferences.The brochure also lists films that can be borrowed from First PennsylvaniaMost of them were acquired from Screen News Digest, a unit of Hearst Metrotone News.The bank purchased several prints of each film and distributed them to area school districts, keeping one print to lend out free of charge.They cover a wide range of topics such as energy, Cuba, and the Lindbergh story.Other films were purchased from other sources, and have a banking or financial theme."
"Seminole, Fla., HC Seeks More Capital",The American Banker,"October 4, 1979, Thursday","The announcement says the company is examining a number of alternatives for adding to its capital base. In addition to selling off assets, it will consider the sale of debt or equity.According to Roger Block, treasurer of the holding company, the announcement was made to comply with Securities and Exchange Commission regulations on rapid disclosure of possible material events and was designed to alert investors to possible actions by the company.He said he is aware of no negotiations now under way.Community Banks is now undercapitalized, one analyst said, but Mr. Block emphasized that Community's concern is how to keep up with the bank's 25% per annum growth in deposits.During the second quarter the company completed the sale of 700,000 shares of common stock, raising $4.5 million of capital. That supplemented $13.5 million of shareholder equity.Mr. Block said the sale pushed the company's ratio of equity to assets above 5%, which is modest for a banking company of Community's size. That ratio will drop as the company adds deposits and assets this year.The company operates two banks, one in Pasco County and one in Pinellas Country. Together they have 23 branches and about $373 million in deposits. The stock was quoted recently at around $6.25 per share.The benefits of liquidation or sale of a bank is the premium that can be recognized by selling control of a company. In many states a bank is worth two or three times its book value. Mr. Block said, though, that in Florida prices have sometimes run under book value over the last three years."
Chicago Bank to Share Experience in Profitable Lending in Changing Areas,The American Banker,"May 11, 1979, Friday","The Community Bankers Training Program, when it is launched in the fall, will be divided into three separate educational components -- one for bankers, the second for community organizations. The third is a one-year internship program at the bank to train persons interested in both neighborhood development lending and careers in commercial banking.The Bankers Program is designed to help experienced bankers better assess neighborhood development issues. The course will expose lending officers to prudent develop lending techniques emphasizing credit extensions and the use of government and private loan insurance and subsidy programs.Among the subjects to be discussed in the three-week course, which has a 12-month interval between the second and third week, are the Community Reinvestment Act and how to assess the credit needs of a community, recognition of creditworthiness of individuals and businesses in the neighborhood development environment, and development lending as it relates to economic viability for the bank.""In other words, for bankers, feeling harassed by all the new requirements, how to make neighborhood reinvestment profitable,"" Beth Wagner, project director of South Shore's new program, declared.Other topics include real estate appraisal, packaging housing rehabilitation so that it is profitable for the bank, buyer and building, and Small Business Administration loans using local development corporations.South Shore Bank is uniquely qualified to offer such a workshop, being the lone bank in the country purchased specifically in 1973 to develop whatever types of business concepts necessary to effect the renewal of a racially changed neighborhood -- 100% white to 85 black. According to a 1972 study, the community of South Shore had but one prognosis: a slum within three years. South Shore has Lake Michigan as one of its borders and is located about 10 miles south of the Chicago Loop central business district.Since then, the bank, a subsidiary of the Illinois Neighborhood Development Corp., a one-bank holding company, has heavily invested in rebuilding its neighborhood with the result that home values have doubled and the crime rate, according to city studies, has decreased appreciably.The Community Bankers Training Program is the culmination not only of South Shore Bank's five-year experience in what it calls development lending but also of its original goals to PrOve such lending could be done profitably and then to transfer the acquired skills to the industry, Ms. Wagner said.The one-year delay between the second and final week of the banker's course of training is to offer time for pragmatic implementation and reinforcement of concepts the banking participant ""is not accustomed to."" Mw. Wagner exclaimed.""The instructional approach is experimential, with role-laying, case studies and other learn-by-doing methods,"" a pamphlet describing the course says. Cost to banks will be approximately $485.The internship program is structured so that participants will spend a good part of the year with various officers of the bank and the bank holding company's other subsidiaries, City Lands Corp., and the Neighborhood Fund, both established in 1978. CLC was formed to engage in acquiring and restoring abandoned properties and TNC to make equity investments in South Shore commercial projects. The full program is being conducted by the parent company's third subsidiary, the Neighborhood Institute, the first tax-exempt organization approved by the Fed to offer educational and other social development programs.The South Shore Bank estimated the cost for each intern -- the bank can handle five -- will be about $16,700 including a $7,000 stipen for the student for living expenses.The Neighborhood Economics Program is also a three-week course but for staffs of public interest and community organizations.It will focus on the ""fundamental structure, opportunities and limits on banks and other credit and capital sources for neighborhood renewal,"" the pamphlet says.To fund the $100,000 program, the bank is talking to various bank and general foundations."
FDIC Approves CRA-Protested Merger,The American Banker,"July 17, 1979, Tuesday","The application had been approved by Muriel Siebert, Superintendent of Banks, last Friday after about nine months of study. Local anti-redlining groups and some public officials had strongly opposed the merger, alleging that Dime's lending record was unsatisfactory under the CRA.While the superintendent's approval of the merger with Mechanics was unconditional, she listed a series of actions which she said she ""will expect"" Dime to have taken before it seeks permission on future applications subject to the state CRA.The New York State decision was released last Friday at 5 p.m.In a 27-page report outlining her decision, Ms. Siebert said that Dime had a satisfactory record of meeting community credit needs. Dime, she said, has by far the largest holding of Brooklyn mortgages of any Brooklyn-based savings bank and had an excellent lending record in Brooklyn in 1977 and from December, 1978, to February, 1979.Ms. Siebert's decision is believed to be the first on a CRA-protested application since the New York State Banking Department's Banking Board in March adopted a state regulation which basically incorporates the rules adopted by the Federal agencies under CRA.These actions include forming within 90 days a division of community affairs, in order to make active efforts to ascertain local credit needs, participate in community development efforts, and consult with local individuals and groups interested in obtaining mortgage and home improvement financing.In addition, Ms. Siebert said, Dime's new division is expected to organize seminars for senior officers and branch managers in order to effectively carry out Federal and state CRA regulations. And it is expected to review the bank's credit determination process, including the development and application of mortgage underwriting, property appraisal and credit analysis standards.Speaking about the aforementioned activities which the community affairs division is to undertake, the superintendent said that Dime's program is to include provisions for a reasonable level of physical presence by appropriate bank personnel in nine zip code areas of Brooklyn and in southeast Queens. Community groups had been particularly critical of Dime's record in those areas.The decision on the Dime-Mechanics application, filed in October, 1978, has been awaited locally for weeks. The New York Public Interest Research Group and other groups opposed to the merger had no immediate comment because they had not yet obtained the decision.Dime is the third largest savings bank in the country and the largest based in Brooklyn. The proposed merger still would leave the Dime as the third largest in deposit size, behind the $5.3 billion-deposit Philadelphia Savings Fund Society and the $4.6 billion-deposit Bowery Savings Bank.Much of the superintendent's report is based on yearend 1977 statistics contained in G-107 reports, which are required by the NYSBD and which deal with mortgage lending. A NYSBD official said Monday that the G-107 reports of savings banks for 1978 are due Aug. 1, 1979.Last week, the New York State Assembly committee on legislative oversight and investigation released a report showing that total mortgages granted by savings institutions declined 24% in number and 13% in dollar amount from the first quarter of 1978 to the first quarter of 1979, the superintendent's decision notes.However, in the same period, Dime's total mortgages increased 14% in number and 16% in amount, while the total mortgages committed by Dime rose by 83% in number and 129% in amount, the decision points out.The superintendent's decision said that the department will not act on any other Dime application subject to the state CRA until the superintendent has reviewed a report -- due January 1, 1980 --activities it is conducting through the division of community affairs. No other application will be reviewed, the decision said, until the superintendent ""is satisfied that Dime's actions have been effective for a reasonable period of time.""In the section about actions Dime is expected to undertake, the superintendent said Dime should take reasonable steps to reduce to 30 days the average processing time between receipt of a completed application for conventional residential mortgage credit and advice to the applicant of final action taken on that application. The decision notes that a large volume of credit applications received by Dime during 1978 resulted in processing delays often extending 60 days or more.And Dime is expected to file periodic reports with the NYSBD, showing the number of mortgage applications filed with the bank, those approved and denied, and other information. These reports are due every 60 days, starting Sept. 30, 1979.""The banking department is aware that Dime is contemplating mergers with other thrift institutions in addition to Mechanics,"" the decision notes.The decision says that at yearend 1977, Dime's total mortgage portfolio was only 48% of total assets, or somewhat below statewide averages. Of this total loan portfolio, however, 75% represented loans made in New York State, a higher percentage than that of many other thrifts. The decision notes that ""the high percentage of in-state loans in its portfolio is particularly indicative of Dime's willingness to meet local credit needs. . .""Discussing Dime's lending performance in the nine zip codes in Brooklyn and in southeast Queens, the decision says that in recent years Dime has not concentrated its branching, deposit gathering or lending in these areas.""It is clear that Dime's performance record in the nine zip code area is not as good as its record for Brooklyn as a whole,"" the superintendent said. Its performance through 1977 in the nine codes (which include downtown Brooklyn, Crown Heights and East Flatbush) was roughly average among Brooklyn-based savings banks in absolute terms, and ranked below average as a proportion of total assets.Dime's community delineation in its CRA statement consisted of all of Brooklyn and Staten Island, part of Queens, parts of Nassau and Suffolk Counties, and Manhattan from 14th to 96th Street.The superintendent basically rejected the argument of community groups that mortgage applications submitted do not indicate real demand. Her report says that Dime closed on about 75% of all mortgage applications received in Brooklyn in 1978 -- and that these applications represented about 29% of all applications it received that year.Whereas the groups maintain that the bank should be judged by its total deposits in Brooklyn, the bank and superintendent agreed that a fairer measure is deposit accounts with Brooklyn addresses at all offices. Based on this measurement, savings deposits from Brooklyn residents grew during 1978 by only 3% while Dime had a deposit outflow of $8.2 million in Brooklyn last December. The bank said that 46% of all accounts at its head office have addresses outside New York State.The FDIC and NYSBD held a joint hearing about the Dime merger case in April.The superintendent's report says that banking concentration in Albany or New York City would not be adversely affected since the two institutions are not significant competitors in the same markets. No objections were received as to Mechanics' performance in meeting credit needs in its communities.FDIC, in a statement accompanying its decision, said: ""The FDIC considers this case to have proven the effectiveness of CRA, drawing together the state and Federal regulators, local community groups and the bank in a common effort to insure the maximum feasible commitment to the local area, together with a program for continuing affirmative action.""A key factor in this case was the interest and effort of local groups calling attention to the bank and to the regulators their concerns and needs.""A source said that FDIC had insisted on commitments similar to those spelled out in the superintendent's decision and particularly relating to the division of community affairs. FDIC obtained those commitments in writing, the source said.The Dime and community groups clashed last year over a proposed suburban branch. Three groups maintained that the bank ""reneged"" on an agreement with them about one month after the agreement was reached; during the interim the groups had withdrawn opposition to the branch application and it was approved.A Dime official said Monday the bank's new executive director of its community affairs division will be Roger Williams, an attorney most recently working at Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corp."
110 United Bank of Ariz. Employees Give 216 Hours a Year to Civic Activities,The American Banker,"January 29, 1979, Monday","Employees responded to the written poll, which was conducted on a voluntary basis.According to the survey, employees donated a total of 1,929 hours per month, or 23,148 hours a year, to community activities and projects.The bank employs 650 staff members statewide.Donated time fell into five general categories: community organizations, service clubs, youth organizations, professional associations and miscellaneous volunteer work. Of the total time donated, 45% was devoted to community organizations.A staff member in the credit area said he has devoted 15 hours a month to the Civil Air Patrol as a second lieutenant and a qualified observer in search-and-rescue missions throughout the state. In addition, he spent several hours a month working with youngsters ranging in age from 13 to 21 who want to become a part of the Civil Air Patrol as cadets.An assistant manager at one of United Bank's offices said she has put in 10 hours a month as a church board member working to organize a new church in the Sun City West development. Having helped organize a church in Illinois several years ago, she chose to participate in the fund raising and planning necessary to start a church for the residents of the new Sun City West Community.Other community organizations and activities in which employees participated included chambers of commerce, the YMCA, United Way, Caballeros de Yuma, the Tucson Trade Bureau, the Tucson Economic Development Corp., the Arizona Academy, the Arizona Sports Foundation, Casa Grande's Los Amigos and fund raising for a variety of hospitals, medical centers and rehabilitation centers.The survey showed that 17% of the donated time went to service clubs such as Rotary and Lions Clubs, whose projects included maintaining a camp for retarded children, sight conservation, crime prevention, and aid to the handicapped and the elderly.One survey participant spent nearly 10 hours a month on Civitian projects, one being the support and maintenance of Camp Civitan in northern Arizona for retarded children. He spent some weekends digging drainage ditches for the camp and putting in insulation in the dining hall.Employees devoted 19% of their volunteer hours to such youth organizations as Pop Warner, Junior Achievement, Girl Scouts, Boy Scouts, youth soccer instruction, little league, 4-H, and the Boys Clubs.One branch office manager said he invested 25 hours a month in Boy Scout activities such as camping, hiking and meetings, and he estimated he traveled between 3,000 and 4,000 miles a year in his camper on Boy Scout outings.Professional associations, to which respondents donated 13% of their volunteer time, primarily focused on such activities as research, education, training, professional support and guidance of career and charitable activities. These included the American Institute of Banking, the Bank Administration Institute, the National Association of Bank Women, the Society of Financial Analysts, Robert Morris Associates and American Business Women's Association.For example, one of the bank's administrative operations officers helped design and now guides a study program for bankers in Arizona pursuing course-work to become operations officers through the AIB.Miscellaneous volunteer work, which consumed 6% of the total time donated, involved individual rather than group charitable work.One bank officer said he has repaired and distributed over 100 bicycles to needy people over the past two years at his own expense. He obtains the bicycles from friends and neighbors who no longer want them and then tears them down for parts or completely restores them, including a fresh coat of paint.The primary reason for employees' community activities was the ""self-satisfaction"" and the ""fulfillment"" the activities afforded them, the survey said."

Strict Supervision Adds to Luxembourg Banks' Success,The American Banker,"December 14, 1979, Friday","A first turning point towards a more fundamental improvement of material conditions in Luxembourg occurred at the end of the last century when an important steel and iron industry developed here. The production quite naturally exceeded by far the scope of the local economy and that's how Luxembourg became a major exporter of steel and iron.After the last war, the Luxembourg government realized that a country with a limited dimension could only economically survive and politically remain independent if, on one hand, it would be able to diversify its economic activity and, on the other hand, it would resolutely and unflinchingly insert itself within the European Community, and play an important part in bringing about the realization of the Community. This explains whythose of our political leaders who played a decisive role in the conduct of public affairs during the postwar period not only have pursued unwaveringly a European policy, but even contributed through their own personal commitment to the implementation of European Community or Common Market. These efforts and endeavors were actively supported by practically all the political parties in Luxembourg and also a large segment of the population.
Luxembourg's European ImprintA first milestone on Luxembourg's road to becoming one of the capitals of the European Community occurred in 1952 when the European Coal and Steel Community established its headquarters in Luxembourg. After the signature of the Treaty of Rome in 1957, othe institutions, such as the European Investment Bank, the Secretariat of the European Parliament, the European Court of Justice as well as the European Court of Advisors settled in Luxembourg. Within the context of this article, a special mention should, however, be made with regard to those European institutions whose activity is directly or indirectly linked to financial operations.The European Coal and Steel Community and the European Investment Bank deploy a most intense activity both in borrowing and lending operations on an international scale. It is interesting to note that 59 bond issues of the European Investment Bank and 51 bond issues of the European Coal and Steel Community are officially listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.Furthermore, some of the Luxembourg banks played an active role in devising as well as promoting and implementing some formulas of unis of account bearing a distinct European imprint.Yet, in spite of the remarkable activity deployed by the financial institutions of the European Community, as well as the studies, recommendations and directives elaborated by the Commission, an integrated European capital market has not yet come into existence. Differences in the economic and political conditions in the member states of the Community as well as foreign exchange controls and restrictions of capital movements in some of these states are the major obstacles for the creation of such an integrated regional market in Europe. Thus, the so-called Euromarket, encompassing short-, medium- and long-term operations on a worldwide scale, has by far outgrown any regional capital market such as would be an integrated European market limited to the countries of the Community.
The Euro-market Operations in LuxembourgThough for many years Luxembourg was already quite active in the domiciliation of holding companies and investment funds, it is only within the context of the Euro-market that Luxembourg evolved rapidly as an international banking centre. In general, four phases can be distinguished in the course of the last 15 years, a period of time when Luxembourg grew into a rather impressive international banking centre.The first phase is linked to the medium- and long-term capital market or eurobond market; the second is marked by euro-currency and international syndicated loan operations; the third features financing operations intitiated and syndicated in Luxembourg by banks active in that centre; and the fourth phase which has set in only recently shows a variety of initiatives aiming at expanding and diversifying the operations conducted in Luxembourg.During the first phase, which started in 1963 when the U.S. Administration introduced the interest equalization tax, Luxembourg's banks became active at the beginning in administrative functions such as the paying agency, the listing and safekeeping of euro-bonds. The absence of any withholding tax on interest paid on such bonds became a major incentive for issuers and syndicate managers to turn to Luxembourg for these functions.Before long, certain banks in Luxembourg also became active in euro-bond operations of a more commercial nature, such as membership in the syndicates of eurobond issues as well as trading operations on the secondary market. The role of Luxembourg, as far as listing is concerned, is best underlined by the following figures: nearly 65% of all eurobond issues, excluding Euro-deutschemark bonds traditionally listed in Germany, appear on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, which therefore may be regarded as the main listing for interna tional bonds all over the world.In Luxembourg is also established Cedel S.A., a neutral international clearing institution for eurobonds. At present Cedel counts 94 shareholders, all banks or related institutions, a sizeable number of which are the most prestigious financial institutions in the world. Cedel services the international banking community, and at present nearly 1,000 banking institutions and brokerage firms are members of the Cedel system which administers eurobonds for a countervalue of over $23 billion.It should also be mentioned that the international banking community has taken the initiative to set up in Luxembourg a computer-assisted trading system for eurobonds under the name of Eurex. This institution aims to rationalize trading operations on an international scale. To a certain extent, as far as its operational structure is concerned, Eurex could be compared to the over-the-counter-market systems in the U.S. Eurex started its activity in October, 1979 with a membership of about 80 banking institutions from various countries.
Second and Third PhaseAt the start, the banks of German origin active in Luxembourg contributed to a sizeable extent to the development of international syndicated eurocurrencies operations in Luxembourg. Later, banking institutions from other regions -- for instance, Scandinavia --also became very active in that field.However, the banks in Luxembourg participate also in international credits expressed in other currencies, particularly in U.S. dollars. Consequently, it is quite natural that over the years some financing operations were syndicated completely on the spot in Luxembourg. These Luxembourg syndications, denominated either in the Luxembourg local currency or in foreign currencies, mark the third phase in the evolution of our banking centre and bear witness to the maturity of this centre.
The Fourth PhaseThe fourth phase has hardly set in. It reveals a number of initiatives and efforts undertaken by the Luxembourg banking community and encouraged by the Luxembourg authorities in order to diversify the range of banking operations and services conducted in Luxembourg. Leasing, factoring, export financing, co-financing, trading in eurobonds, portfolio management, as well as the issue and trading of CDs in the form of ""tranche"" issues or issues on tap are some of the activities which are to be further developed in Luxembourg.The following figures feature most eloquently the rapid rise in Luxembourg's banking activity during the last 13 to 14 years. In 1965 Luxembourg counted 20 banks and the total amount of the balance sheets of these banks was about 50 billion Luxembourg francs or, compounded at the rate of the U.S. dollar prevailing at that time, an equivalent of $1 billion. By now, Luxembourg's banking centre counts 110 institutions whose total balance sheet exceeds 3,000 billion Luxembourg francs, or an equivalent of $100 billion.The banks in Luxembourg originate from many parts of the world, such as the U.S., Canada, the Middle East, the Far East, the Comecon Bloc, and of course from countries of the European Community, from Switzerland and from Scandinavia. In this array, the German segment is still by far the most important one.One of the main reasons explaining the success achieved so far by Luxembourg's banking centre is the rather strict supervision by the Luxembourg Banking Commission. It acts with the necessary flexibility in order to adapt its control to constantly changing market conditions, but also with sufficient rigor and a high measure of efficiency in order to avoid accidents. Its role, in this respect, is recognized and duly appreciated by the major central banks and international monetary authorities; and the Luxembourg Banking Commissioner participates in most of the meetings and mutual consultations undertaken by these authorities.Furthermore, a stable social and political climate, a certain facility of the Luxembourgers to express themselves in foreign languages and certainly, last but not least, Luxembourg's position as one of the capitals of the European Community harbouring, among others, those institutions linked to financing, constitute further factors which have contributed to the rapid growth of the international financial activity in Luxembourg.
The FutureAs far as the immediate future is concerned, it might be reasonable to assume that the momentum of growth will temporarily slacken. The reasons are not directly linked to Luxembourg, but they derive from general market conditions undergoing at present a certain strain due particularly to the restrictive measures taken in the U.S. in order to combat inflation by reducing the supply of money and curtailing credit operations.Furthermore, endeavours by various governments and central banks in order to devise schemes leading to the control of the free international market add to a certain feeling of uneasiness prevailing presently in the international banking community all over the world.Yet, it is not conceivable that all these problems, as serious as they are, will lead to the gradual disapperance of the free international financial and capital markets. In our time, neither international institutions such as the IMF or the World Bank, nor national or regional capital and financial markets can fulfill the role played by the worldwide Euro-market which has proven over the years to be an irreplaceable source of financing as well as of redistribution of liquidity.Luxembourg is intimately linked to this market which undoubtedly is to stay and over the years to grow. This leads us to the conclusion that the present period of consolidation might only be of a short duration and that before long the number of banks in Luxembourg will gradually rise again. The attractiveness of the centre remains unscathed and the potential for Luxembourg's absorbing additional banks and developing new activities is certainly quite extensive. Under these conditions, the immediate and intermediate future of Luxembourg's banking center may be viewed with a reasonable measure of confidence."
NY Mutual Branch Is Opposed Anew,The American Banker,"January 26, 1979, Friday","FDIC officials in Washington and New York explained the general nature of such hearings.Protests from community groups usually are made at the regional office of the FDIC. The director of that office decides whether to hold a formal hearing, an informal hearing or no hearing at all.The hearing is intended to give opponents of an application the opportunity to explain their views.In the two hearings, officials of the affected bank and of objecting community groups participated. They were not public in the sense that any interested person could attend.The regional director decides whether to order a verbatim transcript. Claude Phillippe, regional director of FDIC's New York office, ordered a transcript of the North Side hearing and of a hearing last October concerning an application of the $1.4 billion-deposit Greater New York Savings Bank, Brooklyn.In both cases, the decisions on the applications will be made by the board of directors of FDIC in Washington. The regional director has some authority to approve applications under a longstanding policy, but traditionally controversial applications are passed to the board. The regional director may approve, but not disapprove, an application.The regional director normally would make a recommendation on an application referred to Washington for decision. FDIC will not decide on the North Side application until the New York State Banking Department Banking Board acts on the application, according to an official of the agency in Washington.The FDIC board of directors usually reviews a summary of the facts of an application; the summary may draw from the transcript. In Washington, the agency might request more information on a CRA-related application, such as a bank's current lending activities in its community.On a night of driving rain and wind, the North Side hearing was held in Mr. Phillippe's Park Avenue office, which looks out over the high-rise office buildings of mid-Manhattan.The bank's current mortgage lending policy, North Side officials said, was to offer mortgages on one-to four-family buildings, with one-third down payment and a $100 nonrefundable appraisal fee. The bank currently is not making loans on multifamily buildings, and is not making Federal Housing Administration and Veterans Administration mortgage loans, they said.The bank's position at the hearing was that the bank's primary responsibility is to its depositors, and that the bank's mortgage policy reflects this priority. Sal Tallarico, assistant vice president at North Side and the person in charge of the bank's mortgage department, said North Side had accepted all but two mortgage application submitted in the Bronx during 1977 and 1978.He added North Side had made about $13 million in mortgage extensions in the Bronx during 1976, 1977 and 1978. And John F. Crinnian, senior vice president at the bank, said that last year the bank had an outflow -- exclusive of dividend credits -- of $14 million, of which $7.1 million occurred in its Bronx branches. Most of the bank's losses occurred on Bronx investments, he said.North Side officials said the bank had complied fully with FDIC requirements and that the branch should be approved. Officials from the Northwest Bronx Community and Clergy and Clergy Coalition, Bank on the Bronx, and the New York Public Interest Research Group said the bank had failed to meet the credit needs in the areas of its existing branches and the application should be rejected, particularly in light of CRA. Seven bank representatives and about 25 community group representatives attended the hearing.Lester Pringle, chairman of Williamsbridge Bank on the Bronx, said North Side imposed harsh terms, such as a one-third down payment, which clearly gave a message: ""Don't come here for a mortgage.""He said North Side's alleged redlining practices were hurting his neighborhood: ""Potential buyers are finding it very difficult to get mortgages. Some sellers are forced to move out before a buyer can get a mortgage. Houses become abandoned and a target for vandals and arsonists.""He added that North Side's officers repeatedly displayed an ""arrogant attitude"" to members of his community group. Last summer, he said, group members arrived promptly at the bank for a meeting and were made to wait outside on the street for a half hour.Frances Bodak, owner of several apartment buildings in the Bronx, said landlords in the Bronx are unable to get mortgages they need to make heating, wiring and other repairs. She said that in 1977 she approached North Side about a mortgage on an apartment building she owned and was told the bank did not consider applications on buildings built before World War Two, which was the situation of that building. She obtained a mortgage from Dollar Savings Bank, she said.Ms. Bodak said when she approached North Side in 1978 for a mortgage on another apartment building she was told she had to provide a $300 nonrefundable appraisal fee, which she said discouraged her from applying. Mr. Tallarico later replied North Side had made an offer for a mortgage on one of the buildings but it had been declined.The NYPIRG submission to FDIC states that 857 mortgages were made in the Soundview-Castle Hill, Wakefield, and Williamsbridge areas of the Bronx where North Side has branches from July 1, 1977 to June 30, 1978. In an analysis of property transfers there, it said North Side made only two mortgages in those areas. Most of the transfers were financed by nonbank sources, such as funding companies, purchase money mortgages and life insurance companies, it said.NYPIRG also maintained that North Side's Bronx deposits rose by 7% to $448 million, while the dollar value of its loans on Bronx properties fell by 18% to $35 million, between the end of 1976 and 1977. It based this conclusion on FDIC and NYSBD G-107 data.Community group members said North Side's advertising does not mention mortgage or home improvement loans. They complained the latter were limited to $5,000, which did not suffice for many home repairs.After a series of statements from community groups, Leon Liner, counsel for the bank and partner in Colman & Liner, said the bank has never been found by FDIC and NSBD examiners to violate the law. He said the groups' proposals would cause it to violate the law, mentioned the bank's purpose of conserving and possibly earning money for its depositors, and noted the difficulty for banks of making 9.5% interest mortgages when the cost of their six-month certificate funds was 10%."
Chicago Neighborhood Group Enlists Insurers to Provide Rehab Protection,The American Banker,"April 24, 1979, Tuesday","The companies with some prodding from community groups have been meeting for about eight months with financial institution members of the nonprofit NHS here putting together a possible blueprint for insurance industry participation in neighborhood revitalization projects throughout the country.William D. Plechaty, senior vice president of personal banking services at Continental Illinois National Bank & Trust Co., Chicago, said that insurance is one of those make-or-break links in a chain. ""If insurance people evade their responsibilities, then it becomes harder for credit people to carry out theirs. But if everybody shares the responsibilities, then the whole job becomes easier and everybody in the partnership can rejoice and profit.""Mr. Plechaty, the first president of NHS-Chicago when it was formed in 1975, made his comments during a conference on Insurance Redlining and Reinvestment: Directions for Change held here last month. The conference was co-sponsored by the Illinois Advisory Committee to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights and The National Training and Information Center, a Chicago-based resource and training organization to numerous community groups across the nation.Insurance redlining is defined as the refusal by major insurance underwriters to provide conventional property insurance because of the age or location of a property.The highlight of the conference, attended by insurers, lenders, community leaders and state and Federal regulators, was a pledge by Allstate Insurance Co. of $1 million to be funneled initially and experimentally through programs of NHS-Chicago.Calling it a ""serious investment in cities,"" R. B. Sheppard, president of Allstate, a subsidiary of Sears Roebuck & Co., said the $1 million would be divided into several funds to serve the following functions:$150,000 for NHS of America's internship training program.$500,000 to establish the first NHS redevelopment corporation to acquire and directly rehabilitate abandoned or deteriorated properties.$300,000 for a matching grant program including Allstate's executive staff to assist in contacting other insurers in a drive to fund two or more new insurance industry sponsored NHS neighborhoods in Chicago.The remaining $50,000 is seed money to initiate the insurance-related staff function within the five NHS programs presently operating in Chicago.Costs to the other 18 insurance companies involved in the model project have yet to be determined but will be worked out similarly to a percentage of assets formula currently utilized by the 70 banking and S&L members to fund operations of four of the Chicago NHS neighborhoods. The formula for insurance industry members will be based on the total of home owners premiums written in Illinois.Besides Allstate, the other insurance firms are: Aetna Life & Casualty, American State Insurance Co., CNA Insurance Co., Commercial Union Assurance Cos., Connecticut General Insurance Cos., Crum & Foster Insurance Cos., Firemen's Fund and the Hartford Insurance Group.Others are: Insurance Company of North America, Kemper Insurance Cos., Liberty Mutual Insurance Co., Nationwide Insurance Cos., Prudential Property and Casualty Insurance Co., St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Co., State Farm Insurance Co., Travelers Insurance Co. and United States Fidelity and Casualty Guarantee Co.Continental Illinois in March became the first bank to accept sole financial sponsorship with a $376,000 grant for the fifth NHS area -- Little Village -- located on the city's southwest side.It was during the process of this site selection in 1978 that ""we asked the insurance people to come in and see how we develop rapport with community people,"" explained Frank L. Cizon, executive vice president of Talman Federal Savings & Loan Association here, Illinois' second largest thrift. Mr. Cizon is immediate past president of NHS -- Chicago's central board and still an active member of the board.He said that William Whiteside, executive director of Neighborhood Reinvestment Corp., had initiated discussion with the insurance companies in November, 1977, with assistance from Herbert Schoen, chairman of the Hartford Group after NHS directors -- lenders and community group leaders -- began speaking of the increasing difficulties they were having in obtaining private home insurance and the negative effect it was having in building confidence in the areas where NHS was working.NRC is the Washington-based advisory agency created by Congress in 1978 as a successor to the Urban Reinvestment Task Force. The agency acts as a catalyst in the establishment of the autonomous NHS corporations. Currently, there are NHS programs in 74 cities serving 86 urban neighborhoods. Chicago, with its five units, tops all other projects in the nation.Mr. Schoen, after determining NRC ""is highly responsible and is intelligently working to preserve selected urban neighborhoods"" introduced Mr. Whiteside to the Chief executive officers of other insurance firms. The NCR official told the executives about Chicago's NHS projects.In the meanwhile, Metropolitan Area Housing Alliance here, one of the country's most activist coalitions of community groups, began publicly targeting insurance companies such as Allstate, State Farm and others as ""redliners.""Mr. Sheppard, president of Allstate, the nation's largest home insurer, noted the firm's shock when the charges of redlining were made but, he added, ""it caused us"" to meet with neighborhood leaders in various parts of the country and with MAHA.A series of meetings began in October, 1978, in Illinois with a two-day workshop attended by representatives from 14 insurance companies, three property and casualty industry associations, executives from NHS-member banks, thrifts and community leaders.At that time, it was decided the insurance industry representatives would work toward the development of a full industry partnership with Chicago NHS.In February, the group adopted a set of recommendations for insurance industry participation in the NHS program. These include: 1) contributing to the ongoing costs of NHS programs; 2) identifying one or more agents from each company able to write standard insurance products in NHS neighborhoods on a parallel basis to the conventional loans made by NHS lenders; 3) adding to the staff of NHS offices, resource persons to counsel residents about the various types of insurance available; and 5) participating on the boards and central board of NHS.Additionally, the industry group will work on developing a ""repair cost"" product to deal with the discrepancy between market value and replacement costs of older homes.Mr. Whiteside said that thousands of man-hours were contributed by senior officers from Chicago's financial institutions, among them: Mr. Plechaty from Continental Illinois, James Cain, current NHS president and president of Uptown Federal Savings & Loan Association and Mr. Cizon from Talman Federal.During the two-day conference, Messrs. Whiteside and Cizon flew to Dallas to meet with the Property and Casualty Insurance Council, composed of the CEOs of 30 major firms.""We asked the companies not part of the 19 already involved to take an interest in the Chicago program and other cities and told them we would like to know what other cities they would prefer to operate in,"" Mr. Whiteside said.He explained that NRC is in the process of co-ordinating the regional priorities of the insurance firms with othr NHS cities in order to expand the industry's involvement in another five NHS cities by Sept. 30, the end of NRC's fiscal year.Mr. Cizon says his role in the series of meetings has been to convince officials from insurance companies that initially ""our industry had the same doubts and concerns that they have but that these fears have now been allayed and we are committed.""I feel so strongly this form of partnership between residents, city government, business and financial institutions -- private initiative -- is the answer to permanent revitalization of urban neighborhoods and cities. There's just no way a program from Washington will do it,"" declared Mr. Cizon who last month was named Talman's chief operating officer to add to his duties as executive vice president.Talman Federal was one of the first financial institutions challenged by community groups when in 1973 they began to publicly complain about neighborhood disinvestment and redlining and launched their drive to get financial institutions to lend in declining urban communities.In recalling those early years of grappling with the confrontation tactics of community activists, Mr. Cizon said it was a time of hesitancy and distrust by all sides largely relative to whether sufficient communication could be made to work together. ""We all felt the finger was being pointed at us.""As lenders, the suburban push was still on our minds, we were unhappy with what had happened in the city, particularly the abandoned property problem that resulted from changes in the Federal Housing Administration program in the late 60s, and there was skepticism about whether the city could ever again turn around,"" Mr. Cizon said.""Disinvestment is so complex, not just by institutions but by residents who stop painting, stop cutting the grass, who become frightened their neighbors will move. This in turn not only touches the financial institutions in the area but it also touches the schools.""They get nervous and put in less effort, crime increases, the unemployment rate increases, government agencies lose interest and become lax, in providing even mundane services like garbage collection and the whole mentality of the community goes down,"" Mr. Cizon said.At first, he said, we thought it was just all talk but the talk led us to knowing more about the residents and the residents began to know us as persons and it became easier and easier to develop programs. We found there was a sincerity in many of the community organizers that was not unlike our own.The thrift executive maintained that since NHS programs provide no quick solution, taking up to a year just to choose a site and establish rapport and commitment between the community and the institutions, it also establishes the means to lasting improvements and change.He stressed what other lenders have stressed, that if you lend the work on one house in an area, the effect is about nil.But when all work together on an area, the effect is quite different, and positive. Success breeds other successes. Residents begin to fix up their homes, banks and S&Ls are will to put in their money, politicians get involved and the momentum moves in new directions, Mr. Cizon said.Mr. Plechaty of Continental Illinois also talked of the inter-linked nature of the business and financial system in not providing a service as basic as insurance and the ""deadening ripple effect it can have on a community.As a bank, ""I would say the availability of insurance directly affects the availability of credit. Residents in certain older areas in Chicago who can't get auto insurance will run out of gas trying to find a bank where he can get an auto loan.""Similarly, you don't write mortgage loans without property insurance. And if the loan applicant is unable to get bank credit, it tends to close out other credit options with local business. So everybody loses,"" Mr. Plechaty noted.Both men agreed that confidence is the name of the game in determining whether the spiral goes up or down.An outgrowth of viewing the success of NHS programs is the formation of the Southeast Development Corp., by Talman, five other S&Ls and two banks. The corporation is oriented towards preserving the commercial strip on the southwest side of the city where Talman's main office is.""We've actually purchased some corner buildings and businesses, renabbed them, sought tenants to come in and turned them into economically viable units,"" he said.Insurance companies have a problem in that unlike local financial institutions, they have regional offices but operate nationally.In joining the Chicago NHS program, the companies will learn to relate to neighborhood involvement here and then utilize their experience on anational level, Mr. Cizon said.In Chicago, insurance firms can gain perspective about both the local and national scene.The city has Gail Cincotta, whom Joseph Timilty, state senator from Massachusetts and chairman of President Carter's 20-member National Commission on Neighborhoods called the ""patron saint of the anti-redlining movement."" It was under Mrs. Cincotta's leadership that the Federal Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and the Community Reinvestment Act was passed in Congress.Mrs. Cincotta was also a member of the commission. She along with other commission members met this month with President Carter to discuss the final report to Congress. The report released in March suggests among its many recommendations that the mortgage disclosure act be made permanent and a Federal antiredlining bill for financial institutions be passed.On insurance redlining, the commission found that the availability of insurance coverage is a major problem in low and moderate income and minority neighborhoods. The commission recommended that the Fair Housing Act be amended to state that insurance falls under the purview of the legislation; the McCarran-Ferguson Act be amended to allow Federal agencies to investigate and prosecute in the case of antitrust violations, and that legislation be enacted that would require any state wishing to participate in the FAIR plan meet specific equity standards.Mrs. Cincotta said the President promised the commission members that he would ask all the Cabinet members and specifically Patricia Harris, secretary of Housing and Urban Development, to go through the recommendations and advise how they best can be implemented.Chicago, known nationally as ""the city that works,"" also has a new mayor, Jane Byrne, who in her populist campaign emphasized neighborhood revitalization. She brought hope to the city's innumerable community organizations when she promised to name Lenora Cartright, an advocate of community development and an associate professor of Urban Sciences at the University of Illinois Circle Campus in Chicago to coordinate the city's neighborhood and human services agencies. She has created a Department of Neighborhoods.Chicago has South Shore Bank, the first in the nation formed specifically as a development bank to experiment in new business concepts to effect a reversal in the downslide of the racially changed -- 100% white to 85% black -- inner-city community of South Shore. Community groups consider the bank's 14-page Community Reinvestment Act statement the epitome of what other institutions should strive to do in theirs.Chicago in 1978 launched the first mortgage revenue bond plan. The program, designed to encourage low and moderate income people to move into or stay in the city, is being repeated in 1979 with a $150 million municipal bond issue which was sold in March to Goldman, Sachs & Co., at a rate of 6.835% with 53 financial institutions here participating to offer the mortgages at an interest rate of 8.125%.Chicago, in March, was also the subject of a scathing 69-page report by HUD which charged the city with ineffectual and discriminatory handling of funds allocated under the Federal government's Community Development Block Grant Program aimed at improving and stabilizing conditions in low and moderate-income neighborhoods.Federal auditors who prepared the report said that while the city has been allocated $140.7 million in block grant funds since 1975, it had spent only $82.5 million or 58.7%.The report claimed that in the year ended September, 1978, there were 150,000 housing units listed as suitable for rehabilitation but the city had made only a token effort to renovate them, although funds were available to do the job.And, in Chicago last year, for the first time in seven years, more new housing units were constructed than old units demolished -- 5,097 to 3,711.Aiding the cause of community reinvestment in 1979, besides financial institutions and community groups coming together, is a whole new set of external factors.Mr. Cizon cited the energy crisis, inflation, the emphasis on quality of life and the multiple cultural activities the city offers and the problem of time lost in traveling in and out of the city for those living in the suburbs as favorable factors in slowly bring people back into the city and enhancing land and housing values. ""Moreover, neighborhood people are just tired of running.""But along with the favorable trend toward progress, Mr. Cizon pointed to one of reinvestment's more negative effects and what one housing expert described as potentially the hottest issue in the 1980's --displacement, meaning as values go up, residents who are unable to afford the increases, lose.""We learned, then unlearned and now are relearning the value of doing business under changing urban conditions,"" Mr. Cizon said.Although strengthening a city neighborhood is often seen as a ""good"" work, it need not be unprofitable -- on the contrary, Mr. Cizon said, it can be profitable both in the short and long term. Under NHS programs in Chicago, member financial institutions ""haven't lost a loan.""Since October, 1975, Chicago financial institutions have made a total of 250 conventional loans amounting to $3.5 million by recommendation of NHS staff members. An additional $11 million in loans were made in the neighborhoods as participating NHS lenders saw the need. NHS has also made 120 loans totaling $350,000 through its revolving loan program. According to Bruce Gottschall, NHS-Chicago executive director, in this category there has been a delinquency rate of 10% but the loans clearly were not bankable so ""we think it is a good rate.""Mr. Gotschall said the insurance availability problem became clearly evident as NHS lenders became more active but were forced to go to the Illinois FAIR plan for insurance coverage.The FAIR plan was established by Congress in 1968 in order to make property insurance available in deteriorating-lower income urban areas.Some residents complained at the conference that a few financial institutions were not notifying them that their insurance coverate had been changed from conventional to the FAIR plan. Such a move is illegal unless the institution has a contract that permits it, a lawyer participant said.Clearly, some home owners should be insured by the FAIR plan but when 20% to 40% of the resident in an area are under such a plan it works against turning a declining area into a normal neighborhood situation which is our goal, Mr. Gotschall said.""We'd been aware of the problem previously but thought lending was the first thing to get off the ground before we began to develop a program to bring insurers into a full partnership,"" the NHS executive director said.But Mrs. Cincotta, also executive director of National Training and Information Center which sponsored the conference, said she would not allow ""partnership"" to become another buzz word which is bantered about but produces nothing.She defined the industry's responsibility in terms of three A's -- making insurance affordable, adequate and available.""Affordable means certain neighborhoods are not discriminated against with higher premiums or higher deductibles, adequate means each property owner should have equal opportunity to obtain full protection -- not just affordable. Available means insurance services must be marketed through agent placement, advertising and equal underwriting and application criteria.""Mrs. Cincotta told the conferences the FAIR plan is not an acceptable alternative, noting it paralles the experience with FHA home financing as another dual finance system and a government-sponsored tool of institutional racism for the private sector.She called upon the insurance industry to step up its role in neighborhood reinvestment.She commended Allstate and Aetna Life and Casualty for their efforts. Allstate developed and initiated in 1978 the sale of a ""basic"" market value homeowners policy. The policy makes homeowners insurance available to thousands of people who previously were unable to obtain conventional insurance the replacement value instruments were too costly.Aetna Life will initiate a pilot program this year in the Bronx, Brooklyn, Cleveland, Chicago and Philadelphia that assures there will be no rejections of applications from targeted neighborhoods by agents without complete review by the regional office. Aetna has also formed a corporate responsibility investment committee which looks at investment proposals in housing rehabilitation and redevelopment.Additionally, it has a program called Focus, soon to be operating in eight cities where the field office can make grants to community organizations concerned with housing and economic development.""It will be the next monumental battle, getting insurance companies and pension funds managers -- the capital accumulators -- involved in city reinvestment,"" Larry Rosser, executive director of Woodstock Institute, a Chicago public policy research organization.""Community organizations are merely at the tip in talking to the insurance companies about writing policies and while the industry involvement through NHS is wonderful in the sense that such a special program produces insurers and lenders comfortable with making investment --the long range goal is to have a network of correspondents who develop the expertise to put together investment deals, both residential and commercial, in city neighborhoods as they do currently in the suburbs,"" Mr. Rosser said.Besides some experimental commitments from Allstate and Aetna, most other activity in the insurance industry has amounted to isolated conversations, Mr. Rosser maintained.Mrs. Cincotta told insurance conferees it would be best if solutions to the insurance redlining and reinvestment would come from within the industry -- ""we do not want the expense of more Federal regulation if it is not necessary"" -- but she warned them that if the industry refuses, communities will have no other alternative but to return to Congress. ""We'ved done it before with financial institutions.""Mr. Whiteside was a bit more positive. He said he had been working at keeping cities alive since 1970. He noted that health and life companies have undertaken a project called Clearing House for Corporate Social Responsibility aimed at encouraging insurers to get involved with the neighborhoods. ""It took 30 to 40 years to get cities in the state they are in today --but we are at an exciting turning point. The only problem is that in turning that corner, we start marching up a steep hill.""How steep that march is in 1979 might become evident by following the 25-year-old organizers who head the 700-community member Greater Roseland Organization.Ed Park, GRO's executive director, is intent on utilizing any and every tool available to upgrade and stabilize Roseland, one of 76 communities located on the city's far South Side, about 20 miles from the Loop business district.Roseland is a community of 200,000 low-and moderate-income residents, 90% of them black and the rest divided between elderly whites and Hispanics. Within one census tract are more than 400 boarded-up frame homes, making the area one of the worst hit in the nation in terms of abandoned property.Armed with CRA and mortgage disclosure statements, and the names of 800 people interested in buying the abandoned housing if a means can be found to restore properties, Mr. Parks said that for the last two months he has been negotiating for agreements with financial institutions to fulfill GRO's list of community credit needs.He is also discussing developmental proposals with city and Federal government agencies and insurers.With his committee of Roseland residents, Mr. Parks has met with senior officers of Union National Bank of Chicago, United Savings & Loan Association and Heritage Pullman Bank & Trust Co., all located in or in close proximity to Roseland. He also has met with Mr. Plechaty of Continental Illinois, which Mr. Park maintains has deposits from the area, as does First National Bank of Chicago, which he also plans to approach.James P. Grell, president of Heritage/Pullman, said GRO's requirements are not onerous. ""First mortgages, home improvement loans and Small Business Administration financing -- in their most simplistic form such loans are the business of this bank and we never stop making them,"" he declared.Heritage/Pullman in 1975 pledged a $2 million mortgage fund to finance a community plan to rehabilitate abandoned homes, but the program fell apart as the groups were unable to unite behind the plan. The bank since has worked with groups singly and with Roseland Area Redevelopment Enterprise, a nonprofit offshoot of the Chamber of Commerce which generated funds, and bought, remodeled and refurbished homes. The bank extended credit to buyers.GRO had asked the bank for a 5% down payment on home mortgage loans but Mr. Grell pointed out that it was ""$250 down payments under the Federal Housing Administration that led to the abandoned homes."" So the nonformalized agreement calls for 10% down, with the requirement that any rehabilitated housing unit be owner-occupied. The agreement also calls for a housing and income consultation service for residents. Mr. Grell flatly rejected SBA loans because of delays but has agreed to talk to the business community about some work on the community's main commercial strip.Mr. Park said Mr. Grell had also written Elmer Binford, area manager of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, who ""helped GRO with its demand to have another auction or a sale program for abandoned homes."" Mr. Grell said the first HUD auction two years ago was ""inconceivably bureaucratic"" -- with many roadblocks put in the way.Not only has GRO met with HUD officials recently, but Mr. Binford sent a letter to the community organization expressing the support of his office for speedy conveyance of about 50 abandoned properties, including lowering the price. This letter was given to Aetna during presentations of GRO's investment proposal for the insurance company to purchase and rehabilitate a block of abandoned homes.Representatives of community groups from Brooklyn, the Bronx, Cleveland, Philadelphia and Chicago met in Chicago in April to make similar proposals to Aetna officials.Mr. Grell sent one of his officers to the meeting, at the Conrad Hilton, to tell of the bank's support for GRO's plan and also to illustrate to Aetna how such a program works. After GRO produces a market value for the area, the insurance company said it would come to Roseland to take a tour of the neighborhood and discuss the plans further.Mr. Park will also meet with NHS officials soon, but first he, along with other community group leaders, are combing Roseland streets to find an area with a minimum of abandoned houses in order to qualify as one of the NHS neighborhoods the insurance companies will sponsor. A qualification for an NHS area is that housing stock be basically sound.Messrs. Grell and Park agree that much of Roseland housing is kept up, but Mr. Parks said that because of the vast amount of abandoned or substandard housing and the concommitant problems of unemployment and crime, there were 705 cancellations of home insurance in 1978, potholes were not fixed and many of the streets must be totally repaved.Mr. Pards said United Savings and Union National have also assured they will cooperate.Although Mr. Parks said GRO leaders can mobilize about 2,000 residents to meet over a community issue, he plans no ""public pressures that just anger financial institutions, because we assume they are as interested in the development of the neighborhood as we are. We're not a group that will wither away as others have in years prior, so the banks have a stable group to work with."""
Liberals Mean to Make Sure Crunch in Credit Does Not Slow Social Progress,The American Banker,"November 23, 1979, Friday","Apprehension exists in Congress among those who managed Fair Housing legislation and other antidiscriminatory lending statutes. It is also present among government officials who lobbied for these laws and now are trying to implement them.Their reasoning goes something like this. In times of credit stringency, lending institutions receive an awesome new power.They must ration the shrinking supply of credit to the economy -- decide which lender is worthy, and which isn't. Because of the tensions during such periods, government surveillance of the industry's performance in the social sector tends to be less meticulous. National economic stability is the paramount issue.But this time, there will be a move to keep the pressure on financial institutions to make sure there is no, or at least very little, contraction in the flow of credit to sectors which liberals consider crucial.The Federal Home Loan Bank Board is emerging as the primary instrument in this effort. The thrift industry apparently is the main target. Fair housing and equal credit laws could be used.One reason the focus is on the thrifts is the traditional belief that mortgage lending is the heartbeat of the community. Also, liberals are convinced thrift institutions are the most vulnerable to polical pressure. After all, it seems that every year the thrifts acquire a few more operating powers. Also the thrifts want to keep their deposit rate differential over commercial banks.The message from the liberals to the thrift industry is blunt: You pull out on us, and we go to Congress and tell them you have become insensitive to community needs, and that you no longer deserve your privileged status.Activist groups also are waiting with their lawyers to challenge any credit decision which carries the merest tint of bias. Some of the accepted standards of past tight money periods may be questioned because these lobbies now feel they have the laws to back them up. For instance, they are saying that a policy of lending to ""customers only"" could be illegal. They will argue that the fair way is to adhere to a first-come first-served rule.So far there is no serious conflict, partly because there is no definite proof that there is a problem. Financial lobbies insist they have more pressing priorities then trying to use the current crisis to circumvent antidiscrimination laws.But this does not assure those who fought for the Community Reinvestment Act, the Fair Hosing law and the Equal Credit statutes. They plan to analyze carefully bank and thrift institution credit-rationing policies to make sure they are consistent with the new standard of community responsibility."
Security Pacific Has Credit Accord Of $3.3 Mil. For Project in Watts,The American Banker,"May 18, 1979, Friday","The agreement is said to be the largest credit of its kind ever signed between a private nonprofit urban development agency and a major commercial bank. The Watts area is said to have about 10,000 homes rated at substandard levels.Roy Hartmann, executive vice president of the $16.9 billion-deposit Security Pacific and head of its California banking office group, added that ""this credit, is indicative of the worth of this important urban development agency and the commitment of Security Pacific to the enhancement of this area.""The loan will provide approximately $2.28 million to continue development projects already underway in the Watts/Willowbrook area. $1.02 million will be used to finance housing relocation costs, as the project includes relocating 140 residential units from other areas of Los Angeles. Nine single-family residences and 15 apartments have been completed and a few others are near completion.Financing, upon completion of a unit, will be transferred to permanent real estate loans to WLCAC, which becomes the owner of the properties. The units will be rented to qualified members of the minority community with 75% to 80% of the units subsidized under the Section 8 program of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development.This means qualified minorities will be able to rent a unit at low cost -- that is, not more than 25% of the family's gross income, with HUD bearing the rest of the market rent.The Ford Foundation is providing a guaranty of collection for 50% of uncollected principal for a maximum of 10 years on units not rent-subsidized by HUD. Security Pacific assumes all other liabilities.WLCAC is a nonprofit community development organization started in 1965 to assist in the redevelopment of the Watts community. Ted Watkins has been its chairman since 1967.It is one of the largest and most successful such organizations in the country, with an annual budget of more than $12 million, up from $4 million in 1975.WLCAC programs now reach about 750,000 residents and include two senior citizen centers, management of a $1.5 million child care center, a dial-a-bus service, a manpower training center and a beautification program.

"MORE BUSINESS FOR YOUR BANK;
Images, Profits and Regulation -- Part One",The American Banker,"May 15, 1979, Tuesday","To negotiate this tightrope safely, management must solidify customer and community relations without losing sight of the ultimate goal: more business. A bank that disregards its public does so at its own peril. As Paul Nadler has warned, the man in the street must be placated and won over if banking is to prosper. Witness the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. turndown of a bank branching application because of Community Reinvestment Act inspired protests.Today, the bank marketer must be continually aware of the total environment in which he operates if he is to do his job well.He must be alive to public opinion and aware of all the nuances of the consumer movement. He must be sensitive to the problems that concern the people of his community. Finally, he must reckon with the fact that as a quasipublic institution his bank must reconcile its business objectives with the community's economic and social goals. Only with this understanding can the marketer create an image that not only strengthens the bank's ties to its community, but helps maximize its sales and profits as well.
No Cause for ComplacencyBecause a recent poll reveals that banking rates high on image when compared with a number of other industries, some bankers may wonder what all the shouting is about. But the figures offer no cause for complacency. For in this age of consumerism when the ethics and social conscience of all business is suspect, the fact that banking ranks relatively high in public regard fades into significance in the light of its absolute standing: with only 39% of the respondents giving the industry good marks.Many people today still subscribe to Mark Twain's characterization of a banker as a ""fellow who lends his umbrella when the sun is shining and wants it back the minute it rains."" The insistent clamor for closer regulation of the industry, stems in great part from this picture of the banker's indifference to the true needs and concerns of individual and community.Ralph Nader tells millions of TV viewers that ""banks are leading candidates for closer public scrutiny."" And his words are echoed in the hearings of the House Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs Committee. Like it or not, such charges have marred the industry's image, creating a public relations problem no banker can affort to take lightly.When congressmen accuse you of profiteering at the expense of the public or blame you for inflation; when local politicians decry your role in cutting back the rate of new housing starts and making it excessively difficult to obtain mortgages on existing housing; when activists accuse you of helping South America perpetuate apartheid; when consumerists blame you for short-changing the small depositor -- the question of image is no longer a fringe activity, but one directly concerned with the industry's survival as a free, unregulated enterprise.But if in the light of such considerations, most bankers agree on the importance of image, there is far less consensus on its definition. Far too many treat it simply as a problem in cosmetics.Painting a smile over the old forbidding frown and replacing the gimlet eye with the glad hand and cheery smile may do no harm.But it can hardly sway the consumerist critic nor disarm the legislator out to win brownie points with his constituents.Basically, image cannot be regarded apart from performance: from the way a bank serves its various publics. Looked at in this light, image may embrace such business-building activities as creative selling and thoughtful innovation as much as the more traditional focus on customer and community relations. And as we shall see in the course of this series, banks of all sizes, locations and circumstances have begun to engage in just this type of meaningful and successful image-building activity."
"Mo. Bank, Local Group Resolve Redlining Dispute under New Fed Negotiation Policy",The American Banker,"November 13, 1979, Tuesday","The accord between the $80.6 million deposit Landmark Central Bank & Trust Co. of Wellston, Mo. and a group of Wellston residents is the first agreement of its kind in the nation resulting from the Federal Reserve Board's two-month-old policy of suggesting that parties in a CRA fight get together to settle their differences.Under the agreement, the bank will earmark $1 million for loans in 1980 to help rejuvenate the deteriorating Wellston area. In addition, the bank will lower ton area. In addition, the bnk will lower its lending standards to help Wellston residents qualify for loans.For its part, the citizens group has withdrawn its objections to efforts by the $315 million asset Landmark Bancshares Corp. to acquire Ladue Bank & Trust Co. Landmark Bancshares is the parent company of landmark Central Bank in Wellston.The Fed's new effort to act as a mediator when a CRA protest is made to an application filed by a bank or holding company is an attempt to avoid the time-consuming special examination and related procedures involved in dealing with a protested application.The move was initiated after the Fed and the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland spent over 2,600 examiner hours earlier this year on several protested applications by CleveTrust Corp., Cleveland, parent of the $3.1 billion-deposit Cleveland Trust Co..The applications for merger of three CleveTrust subsidiary banks in Ohio and opening of a de novo subsidiary bank in Cincinnati are still pending. More than a dozen Fed examiners are said to have spent five to six weeks probing the merits of the CRA protest lodged by a Cleveland community group called the Buckeye -- Woodland Community Congress.While discussions about settling CRA protests before a ruling on an application have been under way for several months within the Fed system, the suggestion to initiate mediation efforts at an early point in the proceedings was first outlined in a letter from the Board staff to the district banks dated Oct. 23.The letter says that once a protest is filed and has been determined to be substantive, a meeting should be arranged ""between the protestant and the applicant, together with the Reserve Bank staff.""The meeting ""should help the parties explore their differences, clear up misunderstandings and, if possible, resolve the issues between them,"" the letter said. ""The Reserve Bank staff should mediate the parties' discussions as needed,"" but avoid ""any appearance of partisanship.""In contesting Landmark Bancshares' purchase of Ladue Bank, the citizens group told the Fed that Landmark Central had not done an adequate job of meeting the credit needs of Wellston.Reaching the agreement with the bank was the Wellston community organization which is affiliated with the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, which is made up of about 600 neighborhood groups in low-and moderate-income areas of 17 states.ACORN took a leading role in the negotiations.The agreement calls for Landmark Bank to provide funds to purchase and improve homes in Wellston, a predominantly black community of about 6,000 people on the western border of ST. Louis. The bank will make FHA loans at one-half of 1% less than the standard loan rate.In addition; the bank agreed to:Hire and pay a firm of professional city planners to prepare a redevelopment plan for the city.Continue efforts to establish job training programs.Make an initial contribution of $5,000 to cover startup expenses for a Wellston Chamber of Commerce to replace the defunct one.Open its main banking facility on Saturday mornings for a 90-day trial period.Landmark clearly was on the spot in the dispute. S. Lee Kling, chairman of Landmark Bancshares, was appointed National Finance chairman of President Jimmy Carter's re-election campaign this week. Mr. Carter would have been embarrassed if any of Mr. Kling's four banks got tagged with redlining.Mr. Kling previously has been a target of ACORN attention. Last June, about 200 delegates who were in St. Louis for the group's national convention marched on his home in fashionable Frontenac to draw Mr. Carter's attention to its platform. (Until earlier this year, Mr. Kling was a special counselor to Mr. Carter.)Additionally, Landmark must have felt pressure from the Fed's new policy; even though it is an informal one, as well as the need to meet the new requirements established by the Community Reinvestment Act, which was enacted in October, 1977, and became effective in November, 1978. The holding company is seeking Fed approval to acquire Ladue Bank.The two sides in the dispute were brought together initially by officers of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis under the newly developed mediation policy.William W. Wiles, associate director of the Board's Division of Bank Supervision and Regulation, called Harold E. Othoff, senior vice president of the St. Louis Fed, in September to suggest that the bank try to bring Landmark and ACORN together. Delmer Weisz, a St. Louis Fed vice president, arranged the first meeting, which was held the Fed's stately board room.The Fed offered its facilities for future meetings, but the two sides met in Wellston -- twice at Notre Dame de Lourdes Catholic Church and the final meetings at the bank's offices. The bank was represented by John E. Brock, senior vice president, Jerry Greenblatt, vice president, and Malcolm Klearman, vice president and treasurer.The resident group got Landmark Bancshares to agree that neither it nor its Wellston Bank would ""take any direct or indirect action to remove deposits from Landmark Central Bank."" Last year, the holding company attempted to move the bank to Clayton, a thriving suburban St. Louis office and residential center, and to establish a smaller bank in Wellston, which has no other banks. The effort was blocked by state banking officials. So, Landmark agreed to acquire Ladue Bank, which is only a few blocks from the business center of Clayton.But the Wellston Bank's assets declined $10 million in the year ended Sept. 30, to $36 million. Mr. Brock explained that loans were down and that ""purchased money"" used to fund the loans was reduced. He added that the bank has continued to lose some of its business customers which have moved away from the area.In its efforts to block Landmark Bancshares' merger with Ladue Bank, ACORN told the Fed that the Wellston Bank had made only $108,000 in home mortgage and improvement loans in Wellston in the past four years out of a total of $9.66 million in such loans.Landmark, however, says that in the past two years the Wellston Bank made 25 real estate loans and turned down only four in its primary service area, which includes Wellston and nearby areas. At the end of 1978, 55% of its outstanding loans were to individuals and businesses in the primary service area, the bank says.However, the bank has agreed ""to establish new credit standards and loan terms that are more flexible than the current standards and are more appropriate to the Wellston community.""Under the Community Reinvestment Act, the Fed and other Federal financial supervisory agencies must consider an institution's performance in meeting the credit needs of the communities in which it operates, including low-and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with safe and sound operations, in deciding on applications to expand. Past performance may be grounds for denial of an application to merge, for example.The community group known as ACORN last week was the loser in another CRA case involving Fed action on applications submitted by a pair of Missouri bank holding companies.The united States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia affirmed the Fed's action in approving the merger of Commerce Bancshares, Inc., Kansas City, with Manchester Financial Corp., St. Louis, without filing an opinion on the decision.A three-judge panel turned aside arguments by the community group that the Fed illegally disregarded lending performance standards for bank holding company applications established by the CRA."
Chemical Leads Effort to Acquaint Firms With the Problems of Domestic Violence,The American Banker,"October 22, 1979, Monday","AWAIC is a multi-service agency for victims of domestic crimes. It has been operating since 1975, Doris Moss, executive director of AWAIC said.John Pratt, Chemical's assistant vice president and director of urban affairs presided at the luncheon.Guest speakers were Carol Bellamy, New York City Council PResident, who spoke on domestic violence, and Ms. Moss.Ms. Moss discussed the purpose of AWAIC and some of the many services it now offers. She would like to see the agency services offered to the corporate community.Preceding the speakers was a film entitled Violence Behind Closed Doors, which dealt with some of the treatment abused women received from their husbands.As the corporate community becomes increasingly aware of the direct relationship between the employee's need for assistance in hanlling personal problems (i.e. alcoholism. durg abuse) and his or her functioning on the job, ways are being sought to provide resources in this area.Ms. Moss said AWAIC's professional staff is ready to provide counseling to those employees who are caught in the cycle of domestic violence and who need assistance in dealing with the problem which affects so many people today. AWAIC can be a resource in severals ways:1. If your company has in-house counseling program, AWAIC can train your counselor (s) in how to assist victims of domestic violence. This training includes understanding the issues of domestic violence, developing appropriate therapeutic interventions, and supplying resource referrals.2. AWAIC can provide professional counseling staff on your premises.3. AWAIC offers its facilities (mid-Mahattan) and staff to provide counseling and treatment in a setting that protects the confidentiality of the client.Chemical Bank's urban affiars department became involved with AWAIC when it was first mentional to Mr. Pratt earlier by Nancy Castleman of Fund For The City of New York. During their conversation, the idea of introducing AWAIc to the corporate community was brought about. Later, two street bankers from Chemical's urban affairs department, Dorothy Smoak and Jessie M. Medlock, held a preliminary discussion with Ms. Moss about a lunchoen inviting representatives from various firms to introduce them to AWAIC and also to let them know about its need for additional funds.Chemical Bank as a public service has provided the funds to pay the printing cost for the brochures on Abused Women's Aid in Crisis. The services AWAIC provides are listed in the brochure. They are: telephone counseling and crisis intervention; legal rights and information; Referrals: shelters, public assistance, employement, educations and women's organizations; individual counseling for abused women; individual counseling for abusers; couple counseling; family counseling; group couseling; advocacy and escort service for victims through city agencies; play therapy for children witnessing domestic violence; sliding fee scale; seminar for professionals; training programs for shelter staffs; training programs for hot line counselors; speaking engagements; domestic violence resource library; written material for students; and prevention: programs for communities; institutions and industy.In addition to paying the printing cost for the brochures, Chemical Bank will also make a contribution to AWAIC to help with its financial needs.Isobell Hall, assistant manager-personnel at Chemical Bank, will will assist AWAIC in the area of special recruitment. This will encompass getting jobs for some of the women of AWAIC.AWAIC has undertaken several projects for which it needs financial or generalsupport. Some of the projects are: outreach and bilingual counseling programs for specific ethnic groups; production of audio-visual materials for school-age children in community educatoins programs: family violence trauma; printing 8,000 posters for bus and subway advertising campaign.AWAIC support from 1975-79 has come from 17 organizations in New York City. Contributors of in-kind services were made by Chemical Bank, Community Service Society, Community Council of Greater New York, Cultural Council Foundation, and major radio and television networks."
1st Case in State,The American Banker,"December 4, 1979, Tuesday","That 1977 act was designed to promote bank outreach in communities to meet credit needs, and now the first CRA challenge in Massachusetts has swamped Mr. Mulligan with vociferous opposition from community groups and state officials --to consider the state of economy.The Provident Institution for Savings at $934.9 million in deposits the largest savings bank in the state, wants to expand to nearby Newton, where it has 8,000 customers who have deposits totaling more than $52 million.They are being challenged by groups like the Massachusetts Reinvestment Advisory Group and the Allston-Brighton Citizens Beautification Council, two organizations who have given Mr. Mulligan such statistical data that he has praised them by saying, ""They are not amateurs.""But while they contest Provident's application on the grounds the bank's lending activities have been minimal in the inner-city neighborhoods where they are now located, the bank has formally written Mr. Mulligan complaining that disintermediation -- customer withdrawals -- has hurt its ability to approve mortgages.In a letter from Provident chairman Garth Marston, who took over the job March 1, Mr. Mulligan was urged to consider that the bank has lost $90 million in withdrawals in 1979, but still issued 429 new mortgages worth $27 million, 20% of which were in Boston.The letter -- submitted 15 minutes before a two-week public comment period following a hearing would end --also states Mr. Marston's belief ""an objective review of all the facts would show that Provident has and will support the city in which we do business.""Mr. Mulligan said he expects to make a decision within two weeks and will consider all the testimony, including that from MRAG and Allston-Brighton, and opposition to the bank's request from the Senate chairman of the banks and banking committee, John Brennan, D., Malden.James Carras, executive director of the advisory group, scoffed at Mr. Marston's assertions. ""Disintermediation or not, they have a level for lending in Boston and they stick to it.""Mr. Marston though, after the bank failed to present substantial statistical data or a defense for its application during the public hearing, submitted in his written testimony a plan showing the bank would take steps to increase its community activities.That includes:Issuing $9 million in mortgage-backed bonds to increase the amount of money available for mortgages.A new ""Freedom Certificate"" allowing customers to use money previously tied up in money market certificates, as another way of increasing deposits.Surveying 700 area real estate brokers and the bank's 180,000 savings account holders to determine lending level needs.Creating a new public affairs director position to mediate with community groups and consumer advocates and meet requirements under CRA.Increase donations to neighborhood causes and groups.Establish a community advisory board on the bank, of depositors and community members meeting with bank officials.""The new leadership of the Provident has been addressing the financial condition of the bank, the decline in lending activity caused by the highest level of deposit outflow in history, and the reorganization of the bank to make it more responsive to the credit and financial needs of its customers,"" Mr. Marston stated in his testimony.He added that the bank lending levels are up 60% over 1978 -- a figure disputed by Mr. Carras, who said Provident is including in its statistics a complete portfolio of outstanding mortgages.The advisory group received strong support for its challenge when Sen. Brennan wrote Mr. Mulligan urging the application be rejected. The bank's presentation, according to Sen. Brennan, 'indicates at best a lack of understanding regarding the act (CRA) and at worst a callous indifference to the need for serious measures to meet its responsibility.""Sen. Brennan said Provident's lending record in low and moderate income areas has not improved in recent years, concurring with written statements from the Allston-Brighton group that Provident has taken neighborhood deposits and lent it for mortgages in affluent areas in the city or suburbs."
Fed Exempting Rural Banks From Mtge. Disclosure Act,The American Banker,"January 18, 1979, Thursday","The extension would directly affect nearly 7,800 depository institutions operating completely or partly outside SMSAs at the end of 1977. The majority, 87%, would be subject to HMDA disclosure requirements for the first time, the draft report said.The study concludes that non-SMSA diclosure using census tracts and ZIP code designations, as is done in SMSAs, if feasible. However, the draft report noted that the study did not address the extent to which consumers use current HMDA disclosures, whether the benefits of disclosure outweigh the costs or whetehr there are more efficient mechanisms for achieving the disclosure goals.""These more important questions must be considered in view of the results of two other HMDA studies currently being conducted, one jointly sponsored by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the other sponsored by the Department of Housing and Urban Development,"" an accompanying staff memorandum said.the draft report, which in final form will be sent to congress, said the agency could not make a recommendation now on extending the disclosure requirments because material on consumer use of disclosures and the cost of the requirements was ""still being collected and needs to be carefully considered.""The law became effective in June, 1976, and will expre in June, 1980, unless congress votes to continue it.Currently, a financial institution must prepare and make public an annual report that lists, by each ""neighborhood,"" the total number and dollar amount of certain residential mortgage and home improvement loans in its ""community"" that it originated or purchased in the previous fiscal year. In addition, the aggregate number and dollar amount of originated or purchased mortgage and improvement loans relating to dwellings outside its community must be disclosed.For the purposes of disclosure, a depository institution's community is any SMSA in which it has an office.To the extent that its community was divided into census tracts for the 1970 census, the institution's loans must be categorized on a ""neighborhood"" level by tract. Otherwise, it may use the United States Postal Service ZIP code designation for the dwelling.At present, an institution need not break down by community or neighborhood loans relating to dwellings outside SMSAs.As of November, 1978, there were 283 SMSAs, containing about 690 counties. At the same time there were about 2,500 non-SMSA counties."
Aid by New Co-op Bank Asked for Low-Income CUs,The American Banker,"January 17, 1979, Wednesday","The comments were in a letter from Roy Hollihan, president of NAFCU, to E. Jerome Storey, associate director of the office of interagency and external affairs of the Community Services Administration.The CSA is part of a government task force currently developing financing and lending policies for the bank, which is in the process of being established.The National Consumer Cooperative Bank was authorized by Congress last year.Low-income credit unions are defined by the National Credit Union Administration as those in which a majority of members are either low-income residents of public housing projects, recipients of assistance in a community action program, or individuals whose annual income is within the lowest of three standard -of-living classifications set by the Department of Labor.Mr. Hollihan said there are approximately 400 low-income credit unions.""Most of these credit unions have been on their own, training volunteers in running a financial institution,"" Mr. Hollihan stated.""In order to offer new services, to expand existing services and, for some, to survive, low-income credit unions need technical assistance from the bank,"" he said.Viable low-income CUs are essential to community revitalization efforts, he added."
Displacement Can Be Urban Development Snare,The American Banker,"June 7, 1979, Thursday","Elmer Young, Jr., senior vice president of the $4.9 billion-deposit First Pennsylvania Bank NA, beliebes that too often the community is left out of planning about its future development. Banks might serve as a catalyst through their corporate responsibility departments or discussions with developers in bringing a community into the planning process, he said.Ronald Grzywinski, chairman and director of the $55.7 million-deposit South Shore Bank of Chicago, holds the view that banks should consider not only large-scale redevelopments but also small-scale activities. ""Success in rebuilding cities and neighborhoods of this country requires banks and other players to see development as a long and continuous series of small projects,"" he said.Mr. Young and Mr. Grzywinski spoke in interviews during a recent American Bankers Association community reinvestment techniques conference here, where the displacement issue surfaced, though no workshop addressed it directly.Al Herlands, director of regulations analysis, Comptroller of the Currency, who gave a talk about CRA at the conference, said in a subsequent interview that banks cannot ignore displacement. They should consider the effects of a project which would displace existing residents before deciding whether to make a loan for the project, he said.Mr. Herlandr said that banks considering housing, commercial or any other type of redevelopment project should ask themselves these questions: What are the renovation and rehabilitation credit needs of residents facing displacement that they can meet on a safe and sound basis; and how will making this loan to the developer, as compared to other lending opportunities, affect credit needs and quality of life in this community?At the conference, Mr. Young, who is black, said he had heard of black residents in Philadelphia who were up in arms about a local project they felt would displace them. He said he believed gentrification is good, but not if it forces the complete removal of original residents.Gentrification is a term referring to rehab of a neighborhood by outsiders, typically young, professional and white, who replace original residents. Since displaced residents tend to be black, displacement is partly a racial issue. Gentrification is distinguished from revitalization performed by existing residents who remain.James M. Howell, senior vice president of the $7.3 billion-deposit First National Bank, Boston expressing a view held by many community groups, said he did not view gentrification as a positive good because ""you push people around and don't solve the problem."" Lasting social progress is achieved through ""the middle-classing"" of the poor -- not through gentrification -- he said.Displacement, community groups say, has great social and economic costs, including a break-up of some low-income families and creation of new slums as old ones are rehabbed.Mr. Howell, who holds a doctorate in economics from Tulane University, added that bankers will not understand the ""juices"" at work in revitalization of cities unless they live in the city. He said that four of five bankers he polled informally in an earlier session said they live in the suburb.Mr. Grzywinski had previously addressed the displacement problem in a letter to a HUD official in which he wrote: ""The problem of displacement is one of rights in conflict . . . What is a developer's right to profit in exchange for risk-taking in relation to a resident's right to remain in his community?""Meanwhile, Mr. Young said in an interview that ""banks should be an active partner with the community, developers and the city in planning what's to be done for those poor and disenfranchised people who are to be displaced.""Perhaps banks could convince the city to give existing residents tax incentives which help them keep their homes in the area, Mr. Young said. And banks can offer existing residents low-interest loans for them to rehab their homes, he said.In a similar vein, a local community group representative said bankers considering involvement with a redevelopment should examine the way the resulting housing is being marketed and should look for ways to assist residents who want to remain for example by making home improvement loans.Mr. Grzywinski recommended in the interview that bankers specifically consider how their decisions impact people in their community. And he recommended that bankers, in what he said was the best tradition of American banking, respond to the very different needs in a neighborhood, ranging from facade repair to kitchen rehab.The Chicago banker asked in his letter to HUD whether displaced residents should be given more access to capital, credit and talent resources because they currently have unequal access to them.Mr. Grzywinski also asked whether tools to reduce the incidence of displacement should be handcrafted to meet a local situation and whether more attention should be paid to displaced senior citizens and single parent families rather than to displaced single persons without dependents.He noted that immigrants have been able to accumulate wealth through real estate ownership and questioned whether today's minorities are going to be denied the opportunity to accumulate wealth through property acquisition.Acknowledging the need for continued infusions of capital to preserve multifamily buildings, he suggested that reinvestment might be more likely to be made by individual owners -- through condominiums -- rather than by absentee landlords.Little research has been carried out thus far on the displacement problem. In one report released in mid-February, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development said that minimal displacement of poor people was taking place through the revitalization of run-down neighborhoods. However, it said it will conduct a study in 10 cities to determine the extent of displacement.In another study, Metro Housing Resources, a service, advocacy and research housing-oriented organization in St. Louis, found displacement occurring at a very high level in St. Louis, substantial though abating in Detroit and Toledo, considerable in Chicago, and currently not occurring on a large-scale level in Cleveland. Metro studied the displacement situation for one week in each of the five cities in a HUD-financed study released last November.The study found that ""the great majority of displaced people were black,"" and that displacement threatens to create new ghettoes, with housing becoming even more racially segregated than exists at present. Displacement, it said, is destined to worsen significantly because of demographic trends and governmental policy.Meantime, a study carried out by the Washington Urban League found that black and Latin homeowners and tenants in the District of Columbia were facing severe displacement pressures.This study, released in January and based on a survey of 300 heads of households in the district's low income areas, said that three-quarters of residents surveyed had been residents for 10 years or more and that 73% expressed some or much pride in their neighborhoods. No less than 66% of homeowners had been approached to sell their homes. Renters were under pressure because they could not afford or Were dissatisfied with current housing.The urban league's study recommended insuring that banks do not discriminate against female household heads seeking home ownership loans and urged savings and loan associations to mark rehab loans available for the low-cost return of unoccupied housing to the market."
New Mexico,The American Banker,"October 22, 1979, Monday",
CRA Compliance Necessitates Large Investments in Personnel,The American Banker,"December 3, 1979, Monday","There is much more to the CRA than meets the eye. And most of what lies beneath its surface and between its lines is not very pleasant for bankers.CRA is going to place tremendous pressures on banking -- pressures that will be very costly to us -- pressures that, as near as I can determine, most bankers have not foreseen.By the way, I'm not talking about CRA as a forerunner of possible credit allocation. I'm talking about the Act itself --as it stands right now.Now, if in the course of the next few minutes you find that you can't agree with me, I will have supplied you with a perfect rebuttal. It's this: I have no hard data, or at least very little, on which to base my argument.So I will give you my impressions, my gut reaction based on my observations of the current banking scene and the evolution of CRA.The fundamental problem with CRA is that it's broadly written. It's rather subjective and amorphous. Now this would be laudable if CRA were a poem or a literary essay or a love letter. But it's the law.And when a law is written in the way CRA is, it's open to wide interpretation -- interpretation that can be and will be onerous to banks and other financial institutions.Prior to this, we've had to deal with laws, such as Truth in Lending, which were technically detailed.There's considerable irony here, because the banking industry, once it accepted the inevitability of CRA, worked for just this kind of flexible legislation.In fact, we have generally endorsed CRA, and expressed satisfaction that it won't tie us down to rigid definitions as some other recent banking legislation has.This is something like a condemned man who helps the hangman weave a noose and then tightens it around his own neck.The difficulty is that while the CRA gives us great freedom of interpretation, it gives the same freedom to activist consumer groups and the agencies that administer the Act.Last November four agencies -- the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the Federal Reserve, and the Comptroller of the Currency -- issued a lengthy document on uniform examination procedures for the CRA.It is most instructive. Here are the key areas of activity on which the examiners are to render their judgements on bank compliance. I'll paraphrase and summerize:what your bank has done to determine the credit needs of its community, including efforts to communicate with residents about credit sources;what you have done in marketing to make community members aware of your lending services;the extent to which your board of directors is involved with your CRA policies and performance;whether you discourage loan applications from certain community residents;the geographic distribution of your credits, credit applications, and denials;whether the bank participates in local community development and development programs;your record in originating or buying loans for mortgages, home improvements and small businesses and farms;whether you participate in government-insured or government-guaranteed loan programs for housing and small business, and finally,the category called ""other factors,"" which includes such items as whether you buy state or municipal bonds which assist low and moderate income community development.Just this brief listing -- let alone the full text of the examining procedures and the CRA itself -- indicates that banks are highly vulnerable in the examination process.For example, I can foresee an examiner asking questions like the following (please forgive my exaggerations):Let's look at your facilities. Are they relatively equal in all your branches?Why is this branch in a black community made of tar paper and tin while your Beverly Hills branch was lovingly constructed with Italian marble?Shouldn't that disparity be corrected?What about the level of service? Are your people in this poor community's branch as sharp, as personable, as attractive, as well-trained as your people in that affluent community's branch? If not, why not?What about your automatic teller machines? I see that you have ATMs installed in 30 branches in Hillsborough and La Jolla, and in your headquarters office.But your low-income branches don't have many ATMs, do they? Or is it no ATMs at all? They have to settle for a night deposit box.Shouldn't these areas also enjoy the conveniences of ATMs?How vigorous are your efforts to inform your communities about your services? Are you using heavy advertising, press releases, school programs, community seminars to get the word out?I hope I've made my point. The rules of the game have changed drastically with the advent of CRA.We can no longer market our services only with a view of toward maximizing revenues and profits.This doesn't mean we have to resign ourselves to losing money on business that we take in primarily as a result of CRA.It does mean that we're going to have to establish new criteria for the kind of business we want. Like it or not, we're going to have to be sociologists as well as bankers.I don't believe that there is anything Machiavellian in the way the regulatory agencies have approached their job of administering the CRA.As a matter of fact, from what I can discern, they're as much in the dark as we are about the real sweep and power of the CRA regulations.But regulators must regulate. As the agencies concerned make more and more decisions under CRA, they will discover just how much power the Act has given them.And they will exercise it. Why not? That is their job. And, after all, they are immune to the effects of that time bomb I hear ticking.Now -- is it my imagination, or is that ticking louder? Let's examine three recent cases involving CRA.In late April, the FDIC denied a branch application of the Greater New York Savings Bank, a small, Brooklyn-based bank with 16 branches.In a formal objection to the application, a local activist group claimed the bank had been redlining.In denying the application, the FDIC acknowledged that the bank had taken positive steps toward satisfying the needs of the community. But it also found that it had not made sufficient improvement to warrant a new branch.This is what the bank had done in recent months:it advertised its contacts with real estate brokers;it held meetings with community groups;it reopened mortgage lending to nondepositors;it reduced downpayments on five-to eight-family homes from 50% to 25% and 35%;it doubled the size of its FHA loans to $15,000;it increased the maximum of all loans from $75,000 to $100,000, andit installed a new mortgage action phone in the lobby of one branch.And all of this was judged INSUFFICIENT.It's worth noting that the conflict between the bank and the consumer group had gone on for several years. Also, the bank apparently did not attempt to negotiate a settlement of the dispute.The bank did not comment on the FDIC's decision. But here's some of what the leader of the opposing group, a man named Herb Steiner, said. ""This decision put a set of teeth into the CRA. No longer can an arrogant financial institution bully its local community.""A bank which wants to meet local credit needs must have terms which stimulate borrower demand, have genuine willingness to lend money, and employ affirmative marketing.""Mr. Steiner also said: ""CRA is saying that you can't sit behind your desk and wait for borrowers to come into a bank. You have to get out into the neighborhood and get involved.""Now, when can Greater New York Savings hope to establish a new branch?According to the FDIC, ""continuation of the present trend in performance would indicate that a favorable assessment of the bank's performance under the CRA could be made at some future date, possibly in early 1980.""The second case was concluded in May.The City of Cleveland forced First Federal Savings and Loan Association, a fairly small S&L, to commit itself to granting $15 million in mortgages and home improvement loans over a two-year period.This agreement was reached -- and signed in the office of the Mayor -- after the city challenged First Federal's application for a new branch in Akron. The city made this challenge after First Federal closed a branch on Cleveland's east side, a poor section of the city.The city claimed that First Federal was neglecting city neighborhoods.The S&L argued that it didn't have enough business to keep that particular branch open.The third case I'd like to talk about is a little closer to home. San Diego-based Home Federal Savings and Loan was the target of a coalition of Los Angeles community groups who filed a formal challenge against the S&L's application to open a new branch office in La jolla, a city adjacent to San Diego. The groups charged that Home Federal engages in discriminatory lending practices in Los Angeles and finances ""lien-sale"" home improvement contracts ""which exploit homeowners in the Black Community.""The coalition also contends that based on Home Federal's disclosure statements on home mortgages for the past three years, the institution ""has provided almost no mortgage loans in South-Central Los Angeles.""Interestingly, the San Diego savings and loan has only 10 of its 64 offices in Los Angeles County and so its very presence in the county makes it a possible target for such a challenge under provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act relative to discriminatory lending practices.I don't want to go into the merits on one side or the other in these three incidents. My response is simply to demonstrate the kinds of penalties, pressures, inconveniences and expenditures that are going to be attendant with CRA.All right. Suppose my thesis about the CRA being a hidden time bomb is correct.What can we do to protect ourselves against the coming explosion -- to make sure we comply with CRA obligations both explicit and implicit?Here are some recommendations. You can adjust them according to your own needs and resources.I should say that even UCB doesn't have all of these items in place -- but we're working on them, believe me.
If you don't have urban and consumer affairs functions, establish them.If you do have them make sure they are the real thing and not simply window dressing.Your consumer affairs people must walk the perilous tightrope of representing the best interests of the bank and defending the interest of consumers.From personal experience, I can tell you that this is difficult -- but not impossible. I think they're getting used to me at UCB now. No one throws stones at me any more, and I even get a smile once in a while when I walk down the hall!In urban affairs, you need people who really know what is going on in the community. They have to be able to talk the language of the streets as well as the language of the boardroom. Develop a complaint handling system.At UCB we have a centralized complaint handling system and we are in the process of computerizing this system.Now, at the corporate level, we don't involve ourselves in a complaint unless it's serious -- or potentially serious --but we monitor so that we know what's going on.We can spot trends, and we can see who is and is not doing a good job.The purpose of this system is not to hold a sword over the head of the branch manager. It's to help keep open the lines of communication between corporate and branch and, more important, the branch and the customer.
Solicit business vigorously.As Herb Steiner, whom I quoted previously, said, ""you can't wait for business to walk in.""Use every tool at your command --advertising, publicity, mail, seminars --whatever it takes to bring people through your doors.
Create a speakers bureau.You need a cadre of speakers who can address meetings of schools, service clubs, and community groups about banking generally and about what your bank is doing in the community!At UCB we use to have retired bankers perform this function, but we are now expanding the program to include active employees from various levels of management. Your speakers must be good. They must know their stuff, and they must be responsive and sincere.
Appoint a consumer compliance officer.At UCB we chose a person with 25 years of consumer credit experience. He is an expert on CRA and other regulatory matters. This job is his primary duty and he has proven his worth time and time again.
Beef up your school programs.Schools cannot get enough good information about banking services to use in their classrooms.Movies, filmstrips, brochures -- these and other materials are badly needed.UCB is a subscriber to the ""You and Your Community Bank"" program. We also recruit in the schools and have various work-study programs for high school and college students.School programs can accomplish a great deal for you.By performing a genuine service, you will build good will. You will develop future customers and employees. And you will gain favorable exposure for your efforts.
Improve your counseling services for loan customers.One of the most important things we can do is provide alternative suggestions to our customers when we turn down a loan.Instead of flatly saying no to a home application, for example, we may be able to suggest that if the applicant pays off a car loan or a consumer finance loan, his application may be considered.
Expand and improve your training.To offer the kind of services I'm talking about, we must have highly qualified people. They must be intelligent, sensitive, and well trained to carry out these assignments effectively.
Hire more minority branch managers.We need more women, more blacks, more Hispanics, more Asians in positions of responsibility in our branches.I know that banks have been making significant improvements in this area, largely as a result of equal opportunity employment legislation. But I'm not speaking about doing this for our emp ployees -- which, of course is fine.I'm looking at it as a customer relations matter.The bank that has minority people in important positions is going to attract minority customers -- and that, of course, is a major obligation under CRA.Needless to say, the kind of programs I'm recommending will be very expensive.And you'll find that once you start them, the examiners expect you to continue them.But if we don't make these investments, our costs will be much greater.Let me touch now on what I see as a positive aspect of CRA.I have long believed that there is much solid untapped business in our low-income communities. At the least, CRA gives us a strong incentive to develop that business.There's no doubt in my mind that a lot of potential loan customers have not sought loans from us because they believed they'd be turned down.But the business is there -- I know that -- and at UCB we're finding it where we never before dreamed it existed.To sum up, our experience with CRA is likely to be quite similar to that of the man who brings home a cuddly kitten and finds it turning into a full-grown, ravenous lion right before his eyes.Under the pressures of consumers and regulators, we're going to have to make large investments in personnel, services and facilities in order to comply with CRA. Much larger investments than we as bankers are generally willing to commit to expense areas like this.At the same time, there are benefits to be gained from this situation.First, CRA is forcing us to explore areas of new business and new profits.Second, if banks respond to the demands of CRA in a really positive manner, we will enjoy the lasting good will of our customers and the communities we serve.Third, don't neglect to promote your good works -- let the world know about the good things you've accomplished in your community. Use your public relations and news bureau to their maximum.Doing these things might even help to stem the tide of anti-business feeling that is so strong in the country today. But such hopes are for the future.In the short term, I believe that we are going to see rough times under the CRA.If we face up to this, if we plan for it, if we make the commitment compliance demands, we just might defuse that bomb I hear ticking.If we aren't prepared to do these things -- then say your prayers and run for cover."
Comptroller Issues 1st CRA Denial,The American Banker,"December 3, 1979, Monday","This is the Comptroller's decision on an application to merge Bank of Indiana NA, Gary, (hereinafter, ""Bank""), into and under the charter of Indiana Interim National Bank (organizing), Gary, Ind., (hereinafter, ""Interim Bank""). This application is part of a process whereby Money Management Corp., Chicago, a registered one-bank holding company that currently owns 99.3% (less directors' qualifying shares) of Bank, will acquire the remaining shares of Bank and thereby own 100% (less director's qualifying shares) of Bank through the resulting bank. As part of the process, Money Management Corp. sponsored a charter application for a new national bank, which was preliminarily approved by this office on Oct. 20, 1978. This merger therefore merely combines a corporate shell with an existing bank. As such, it presents no competitive issues under the Bank Merger Act, 12 U.S.C. 1828 (c).In deciding the application, this office is required to evaluate the Bank's record in helping to meet the credit needs of its community. 12 U.S.C. 2903. Accordingly, as a result of three consumer examinations conducted between November, 1977, and March, 1979, an extensive record has been developed regarding the Bank. These examinations have revealed serious problems with the Bank's performance under the Community Reinvestment Act, including lack of participation with respect to lending within neighborhoods in the city of Gary, no evidence of meaningful communication with members of the community regarding banking services, and no marketing or special credit-related programs to make residents of Gary aware of the Bank's credit services. The examinations also reveal evidence of discriminatory lending policies and practices which impact the Bank's CRA performance.
Encouraged by the LawThe Bank's CRA record raises serious concerns, and has been determined by this office to be less than satisfactory. It should be noted at the outset that the Community Reinvestment Act, 12 U.S.C. 2901 et seq., does not require that banks meet every credit need of their community, nor does it dictate that a certain proportion of a bank's loan portfolio be concentrated in loans to persons residing or doing business in low-and moderate-income neighborhoods. In other words, credit allocation is neither contemplated nor required by the law. However, the law does contemplate a regulatory scheme which encourages financial institutions to assist affirmatively in addressing community credit needs in a meaningful fashion, and requires that the four Federal financial regulatory agencies ""assess the institution's record of meeting the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operation of such institution."" 12 U.S.C. 2903.The agencies have attempted to carry out this responsibility in a manner which fulfills the intent of the law, yet accommodates simultaneously the need to preserve the institution's ability to determine how best to carry out its community lending responsibilities and to meet its fiduciary responsibilities to depositors and shareholders. A balancing of these considerations is reflected in the CRA Regulation, which set forth a series of assessment factors to be used by the agencies in evaluating CRA performance. 12 CFR 25.7. The assessment factors make clear that a bank's financial condition, size, and legal impediments, local economic conditions, and other factors will be considered in assessing its ability to meet various community credit needs. 12 C.F.R. 25.7 (k). In addition, the assessment factors address the institution's actual record of performance in meeting community credit needs.The assessment factors provide a means by which the agencies can evaluate the institution's CRA record without mandating that the institution conform to a rigid set of minimum standards. The use of multiple factors for assessing performance makes it possible for a bank to perform with a less than satisfactory record under one factor, and to compensate for this record by having an above-average performance under other factors. The agencies evaluate the bank's performance under all factors to determine whether its total record represents an affirmative response to its obligations under CRA.A review of the record attending the application of the Bank, and other information, reveals evidence that the Bank's record of helping to meet the credit needs of the city of Gary, including low-and moderate-income Gary neighborhoods, is, taken as a whole, less than satisfactory.Activities conducted by the Bank to ascertain the credit needs of the residents of low-and moderate-income neighborhoods in the city of Gary, including efforts to communicate with the residents of Gary, have been extremely limited. The CRA assessment factors emphasize the importance of such efforts, which include initiating programs and discussions with residents and businesses to ascertain credit needs, establishing working relationships with real estate brokers or others who do business in Gary, and advertising credit services in media likely to reach allsegments of the Gary population. 12 CFR 25.7 (a),(b).
Discriminatory Lending PracticesThe CRA assessment factors emphasize the importance of extending housing-related credit and also provide for assessment of any activities intended to discourage loan applications. 12 CFR 25.7(i) and 25.7(d). While the Bank has had a history of granting one-to-four family residential mortgage loans, it adopted in January, 1978, loan terms requiring downpayments, compensating balances and interest rates significantly above those prevailing in its market. This office has found that the clear effect of such terms is to discourage applications for such loans, particularly from residents of low-and moderate-income neighborhoods. The Bank's mortgage lending activity has diminished sharply as a result.The assessment factors require a comparison of the institution's performance in low-and moderate-income areas to its activities in the community as a whole. 12 CFR 25.7(e). A review of the geographic distribution of the Bank's credit extensions, credit applications, and credit denials indicates a consistent disparity in credit availability between the city of Gary and its surrounding suburban communities.The city of Gary was receiving disproportionately lower amounts of instalment, commercial, and housing-related credit, and was experiencing significantly higher denial rates. In addition, for housing-related credit, there were dramatic disparities between low-and moderate-income census tracts and those with above-moderate household incomes.The assessment factors require the agencies to consider any evidence of discriminatory lending practices. 12 CRF 25.7(f). A number of the Bank's loan terms and underwriting criteria have raised substantial questions as to their discriminatory effect on minorities and residents of low-and moderate-income areas. These include minimum loan size for both commercial and residential loans, excessively restrictive credit rating requirements, and minimum floor area size requirements for homes for which mortgage loans were being sought. Many of the Bank's discriminatory policies were removed only after the filing of its application. Furthermore, the Bank has repeated violations of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act even after having them cited in examinations by this office.If each of these deficiencies in the Bank's record were viewed individually and represented an isolated problem, disapproval of the application might not be warranted. Similarly, these deficiencies might not be a basis for disapproval of the Bank had performed in an outstanding manner under other assessment factors. However, under the provisions of CRA and the implementing regulation, the agencies are required to review the overall performance of the Bank, taking all factors into account. The agencies must determine whether the Bank's total record constitutes an affirmative effort to identify and help meet community credit needs, consistent with its basic responsibility to respond to the convenience and needs of the community it was chartered to serve, including low-and moderate-income areas.
Made AmendsTaken as a whole, it is clear that the cumulative effect of the Bank's performance under the CRA assessment factors constitutes an unsatisfactory record. The Bank has not demonstrated an affirmative approach to any CRA assessment factor. It has clearly performed inadequately in low-and moderate-income areas. No evidence has been offered which persuades this office that the Bank's size and condition, the condition of the local economy, legal barriers, or other extenuating circumstances justify its failure to respond to credit needs of Gary or to inform Gary neighborhoods of the Bank's credit services. In light of all of these considerations, the Bank's poor record of performance under CRA necessitates the denial of this application.It should be noted that the Bank has recently taken some steps to improve its record of performance, including the appointment of a president for Gary affairs. In addition, it has made a commitment to make $10 million of credit available over the next five years to qualified borrowers in the downtown Gary area, subject to completion of a civic center complex and construction of a U.S. Steel office tower. The Bank has also indicated its willingness to consider participating in the city's housing rehabilitation loan program.Those actions, along with the recent changes in the Bank's loan policies are encouraging. However, it is impossible for the office to feel confident that they will result in a substantially improved CRA performance by the Bank. The changes in mortgage loan underwriting standards will have no practical effect as long as the Bank adheres to its policy of discouraging mortgage applications through unfavorable interest rates and loan terms. The Bank's willingness to consider participating in the rehabilitation loan program is not a firm commitment to undertake any action, and the $10 million downtown lending commitment is qualified by extensive contingencies.
Insignificant ImprovementsBecause these recent steps constitute commitments primarily for uncertain prospective action and do not represent significant improvements in the Bank's actual performance, they are not sufficient to warrant approval of the application. This office has indicated in a prior opinion on the CRA-related application that recently undertaken improvements by an applicant can be considered favorably under CRA, even if total performance is still less than adequate. (See dissenting opinion on application to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. by the Greater New York Savings Bank.) That opinion emphasized, however, that such recent improvements may be valid considerations if, and only if, they are of a significant magnitude, and have been in effect long enough to demonstrate that they are already strengthening the Bank's performance and should eventually result in a satisfactory performance level. It must be emphasized once again that token improvements or policy changes undertaken immediately prior to or during submission of an application cannot be construed as constituting good-faith compliance with the spirit of CRA.This office encourages the Bank to follow through on its recent and proposed actions in response to CRA and to review other areas in which improvements can be made. Subsequent examinations may yield a judgment that approval of future applications will be warranted.Accordingly, applying this statutory criteria, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has concluded that this application is not in the public interest and is thereby denied."
State St. Seeks to Close Branch,The American Banker,"October 7, 1979, Sunday","The request has been challenged by neighborhood groups and the consumer activist Massachusetts Urban Reinvestment Advisory Board, which will be reviewed at an Oct. 16 public hearing scheduled by Mr. Mulligan.Daniel Morley, vice president of public affairs for State Street, said the bank has been unable to compete with mutual savings banks in the area and that its huge building at the corner of Massachusetts Ave. and Boylston St. ""makes it economically unfeasible to operate.""State Street opened the branch 75 years ago and if it is allowed to close, it will follow the First National Bank of Boston in leaving an area where merchants and community groups are trying to revitalize the economy and buildings.Hugh McCormack of MURAB said the branch still has 580 existing commercial accounts and showed an increase in deposits last year of $1 million to a total of $6 million although bank officials have cited ""low profitability expectations.""Opponents also said State Street wants to leave in order to sell the building to the nearby Berklee School of Music and realize the profit from that sale. Mr. McCormack charged also that the bank did not adequately notify residents of its intentions, except through required legal advertisements, an assertion disputed by Mr. Morley who said there were notices in the bank's 15 branches.Mr. McCormack also contends the bank is doing everything it can to discourage customers from banking there in an attempt to prove the branch's unprofitability. ""They've refused safe deposit boxes and use it as a teller training area to discourage people,"" he added.He said the bank's request is contrary to Federal Community Reinvestment Act guidelines requiring banks to meet community needs. ""They've done no outreach in the community. They've done nothing for it,"" he said.Mr. Morley, however, maintains that customers can be retained without keeping the branch open and that the area, composed mainly of students and small businesses along a busy strip surrounded by universities, schools, and the huge Christian Science church complexes, is not establishing itself as a profitable area for banks.He said the bank has had a ""strong campaign"" in recent years to identify new accounts and that some deposits are credited to the branch which should not be because ""we're trying to justify some profitability to the branch.""""Part of the problem with these groups is that they don't understand a bank doesn't need branches to meet the needs of the community,"" Mr. Morley said. ""This is a very difficult competitive problem for commercial banks.""Mr. Morley added that if the branch is allowed to close -- he hopes by the yearend -- customers could be served by State Street's nearby Copley Square branch, less than a mile away down Boylston St.Groups opposing the closing also include the Massachusetts Ave. Board of Trade, whose president, Morey Glazer, a shoe store owner, has been a depositor there for 31 years.""Up until now I've found them marvelous and very cooperative,"" he said. ""I've established a good credit rating and borrowed money and paid it back on time or ahead of time. If they get out, I, and I mean we here, have to turn around and establish new credit in a new bank. Everybody on the street does.""A meeting of community groups has been planned for next Wednesday to prepare for the hearing before Mr. Mulligan. According to Mr. McCormack, they have support from Sen. Paul. A. Tsongas D., Mas., and will point out that only a small branch of the Shawmit Bank of Boston NA would be left in the area to offer commercial bank services.""We do not want to lose that bank,"" Mr. Glazer explained."
Correction,The American Banker,"May 24, 1979, Thursday","First Federal lent $3.8 million in 1977 and $3.2 million in 1976 to Clevelanders for mortgages and home repair loans.""If the really big billion-dollar savings and loans follow first Federal's lead, we will really begin to see some changes in Cleveland's neighborhoods,"" said Mr. Nicholl (Jack Nicholl, Cleveland community development commissioner).A First Federal spokesman said work will begin immediately on creation of a Reinvestment Task Force which, it is hoped, will include the other savings and loans along with community leaders and urban specialists.Representatives of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board have agreed to cooperate in the reinvestment effort, the spokesman said.The city will now withdraw its challenge to the new branch in Stowe. Last November about 10 persons, including clergymen and other community leaders, met with the First Federal officials to voice concern over the closing of the Mount Plesant branch.First Federal later donated its equipment and former office to a clergymen's group which hoped to establish a money exchange at the site and continue to help the neighborhood by cashing checks, writing money orders and handling utility bills.First Federal has also agreed to sponsor a series for consumers on financial education and counseling."
Mich. Charter Protests to Use CRA,The American Banker,"January 29, 1979, Monday","Months before the CRA went into effect last November, Michigan banks -- on five separate de novo bank and branch applications -- had raised the question of whether the CRA statement could be used as a legal mechanism to protest such applications.In one of the cases, attorneys for the McPherson State Bank of Howell, contesting the branch application of Community State Bank of Fowlerville, asked in a prehearing whether the CRA should be incorporated as part of Michigan branching law.The issue emerged again in the branch application of Old Kent Bank & Trust Co., Grand Rapids. In this instance, according to Gary Mielock, assistant director in the bank and trust division of Michigan's Financial Institutions Bureau, an administrative law judge ruled last summer ""it appears the FIB is without authority to proceed under this Act because the CRA applies only to Federal regulatory agencies and, therefore, is not a proper issue to come up before a state hearing.""Althought the expectation has been that community groups would be the primary users of the CRA, particularly after the Feb. 4 deadline for compliance with its basic requirements, Richard J. Francis, FIB commissioner, said he was not surprised that financial institutions would utilize it as well.""When involved in a protest, a protestant tends to use any argument he can and the CRA raises issues of past performance and credibility of a financial institution.""Noted attorneys have already maintained the CRA would become nationally a major point of contention among financial institutions,"" the commissioner said.Regulations for CRA requires every financial institution to delineate on a map the ""entire community"" it serves; adopt through its board of directors a CRA statement listing specified types of credit is prepared to extend within that community; post notice in each of its offices that a copy of the statement is avaiable; maintain a file for public comments also to be available for public inspection.Mr. Mielock said the essential factors examined under Michigan law to establish a de novo bank are: whether the convenience and the needs of the public will be serviced by the proposed bank; examination of the character, responsibility and fitness of the incorporators and proposed directors and officers; likelihood of a successful operation; capital adequacy.To establish a branch, the basic factors are: sufficiency of capital and surplus of the applicant bank, prospects for a successful operation, necessity for establishment of the branch and the state's 25-mile geographic limitation.Beyond these categories, there are a whole group of sub-issues that can be raised in a challenge to an application, Mr. Mielock said.In an application to establish the de novo Michigan Bank-Livingston, one of four filed in 1978 by subsidiaries of Michigan National Corp., Bloomfield Hills, 12 other issues besides the CRA were invoked by five protesting banks.The question of whether CRA applies also emerged in the Bloomfield hills holding company's applications to open state-chartered banks in Petoskey and Midland. The issue was not raised in the fourth application to establish the de novo Michigan Bank-South Metro in Lincoln Park, Wayne County.""So the focus here in attempting to use the CRA as a grounds for protest is the community convenience and needs provisions of our banking law,"" Mr. Francis, the commissioner said.""All protests on the basis of the CRA have been withdrawn because the administrative law judge indicated the Bureau didn't have a clear policy direction,"" he said.The Commissioner said the Bureau will issue, probably in early February, either guidelines or an order on the incorporation of the CRA into the state's convenience and needs statement. The Bureau is also considering requiring the filing of a CRA statement by banks who use the Act to protest.Some thought had been given to changing the ""needs"" provision of Michigan law in deference to CRA.However, Mr. Francis said the Bureau had decided it is up to the state to evaluate what the appropriate level of service to the community should be.""Otherwise, we are simply abdicating our rights to the Federal agencies,"" he maintained.The commissioner said that three other states -- Georgia, Ohio and Washington -- were addressing CRA as primarily the prerogative of the state and its regulators.The branch applications of Old Kent Bank and the State Bank of Fowlerville are still pending. A hearing to consider the Fowlerville application has been set for June 13.Harold L. Swindell, vice president of the Fowlerville bank, said he doubted the CRA in the final analysis would become an ""issue"" in his bank's attempt to set up a branch in an unincorporated area of Howell Township, Livingston County.He said his bank's CRA statement has been approved and filed. He added that he was not surprised that protesting banks would seize the CRA to block the expansion of competitors.Michigan National has withdrawn all of its applications and resubmitted them under Michigan's shortened procedures statute that went into effect in December.Under the statute, a protested branch or de novo application must be processed including any appeals, within 135 days as opposed to the average of 356 days it had taken under old regulatory procedures.Alan W. Ott, president of Chemical Bank & Trust Co., of Midland, one of two banks which contested the application to establish Michigan Bank-Midland, said he was uncertain if the bank would once again invoke the use of CRA as the basis for argument.""Actually, the CRA issue was withdrawn before it ever reached hearing stage,"" Mr. Ott said. He explained that in Michigan, all participants and issues to be addressed in a contested action are determined at a prehearing. Moreover, the applicant bank most probably will have an approved CRA statement which might prove difficult to challenge, the Midland bank president said.In a separate but related matter, Mr. Francis, the commissioner, critized financial institutions for approaching the CRA strictly on a ""how-to -- letter of the law"" basis by delegating responsibility for the Act to their compliance divisions.""That approach completely misses the objective of the Act,"" Mr. Francis said in a speech before bankers attending a Community Reinvestment Workshop sponsored by the Michigan Bankers Association in December.It was because of their concern that financial institutions would take this approach that Federal regulators mandated development of the CRA statement to the board of directors, who might also adopt a ""spirit of the law attitude that transcends the detail and redefines how a bank views its community and its services to it,"" Mr. Francis said."
Oregon Chief Warns Bankers on Compliance,The American Banker,"December 10, 1979, Monday","Mr. Olin, speaking at the Oregon BA annual midyear conference here, called the survey results ""interesting and alarming,"" and characterized federal examiners as zealous in their determination to seek out non-compliance.The survey, he sais, showed that three-fourths of the banks here did not code loan or credit applications to indicate whether they were from low or moderate income areas, that 30% of the banks were not involved in community redevelopment programs, that 80% did not receive public comment on their policies from community groups, and that 40% felt the regulations should be repealed.Mr. Olin conceded that the CRA represented ""a very difficult set of regulations,"" but said they ""are so wide open the Federal examiner can cause you sleepless night if he feels you are in non-compliance.""Mr. Olin characterized Federal examiners as a ""new breed"" who are not just interested in soundness and safety in banking. ""They went to Dartmouth and turned left,"" he quipped.During the meeting, the banks who are also members of the State Chartered Banks of Oregon elected as their new president Lloyd A. Penner, president of the Bank of Willamette Valley, The Dalles, Ore. Don Barth, president of the Bank of Newport, was named vice president, and Chuck Brummel, chief executive officer of Security Bank of Coos County, was named secretary."
Maryland,The American Banker,"December 7, 1979, Friday","UNION TRUST BANK, Baltimore: Gary E. Mesing and Donald E. Warren have joined the bank as assistant vice presidents.

Boston Mtge. Monitor Going Statewide,The American Banker,"May 11, 1979, Friday","Now, as a result of settelment in an unrelated decade-old lawsuit, the group will get $45,000 with which to spread its bank monitoring throughout the state.The JPBMC was one of eight consumer protection groups in Massachusetts awarded shares in $200,000 made available by the Household Finance Corp. and the Beneficial Finance Corp. in a settlement which brought dismissal of a state suit alleging violations of small-loan laws.The announcement of the disbursement was made this week by Francis X. Bellotti, Massachusetts attorney general; Richard Berten, executive secretary of the Consumers Council, and Gerald T. Mulligan, Commissioner of Banks.The funds will be disbursed by the $1.4 billion-deposit Shawmut Bank of Boston NA next month after trustees have evaluated the eligibility of the eight designated recipients, chosen from among 30 by a three-member distribution committee of the Credit Foundation, itself created in November to find groups needing the money.The Jamaica Plain group, established four years ago, has been successful in getting bankers to visit neighborhoods said to have been ""redlined"" and lower amounts needed as down payments on homes -- all achieved by deliberation instead of activism.""We're going to see to it banks are meeting social needs,"" Hugh McCormack of JPBMC said.He said the activities will include monitoring of compliance with the Federal Community Reinvestment Act under which a bank must prove it is meeting community needs before it can get a new branch approved. Mr. McCormack said the committee will look at the affidavits of community service required of banks that are Federally regulated.The emphasis, he added, will be on preventing neighborhood discrimination in the Jamaica Plain section of Boston, but help will be offered groups in cities like Lowell, Lawrence, Fall River, New Bedford and Fitchburg in setting up similar monitoring systems.""You can look at census tracts and find out where banks are not making loans,"" he said.

Urban Renewal Works Given Time and Careful Planning,The American Banker,"October 15, 1979, Monday","Across the country, all of us have observed various approaches to restoring declining neighborhoods. Some of these methods have worked effectively, with successful results. Other plans have been colossal failures.Too often in the past, urban renewal progress has been measured by construction activity alone. New buildings were the most obvious indication that the restoration process was working --if at all.But an effective urban renewal project is more comprehensive and far-reaching in scope than simply replacing old buildings with new brick and mortar. Revitalization of an inner city calls for a wide-ranging effort that may take years to complete, and is sensitive to the needs of industrial, commercial, residential and institutional interests.It was this insensitivity to the concerns of business and residents that often led city fathers to be too quick on the trigger, overanxious to excercise their awesome authority. Government acquired properties and cleared land with a shotgun approach to eradicating blight, wiping out whole areas to make room for new developments, which in many instances fell through before they got started.This wasn't urban renewal; it was urban devastation. The wholesale wipeout of business and industry occurred time and time again throughout the country, sapping an area of their tax base.This approach to curing inner city ills was tried and failed in Chicago. Urban renewal experts and private real estate developers moved into an area immediately west of the Loop, part of which included the Skid Row district. Bulldozers and wrecking crews cleared away some of the seamiest buildings, with a promise of $350 million in private investment funds. Three years later, the plan was cancelled dropped in part because financing disappeared.Today, in communities across the country, business and political leaders are working together, using far more thoughtful and prudent actions than before. They're moving first to preserve the status quo and then to create an atmosphere where business can begin to grow.Financial institutions have a particularly significant obligation. Those that move take with them the financial strength that is needed for a community to sustain itself.Our bank considered moving out of the near west side of Chicago some years ago. But it was decided to remain, feeling we had an obligation to support the community, while maintaining service to our customers and our obligation to our stockholders. We were convinced that by moving out we would help accelerate the decline of the near west side.We have observed that anticipating the decline of a central city can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. But it can also be the catalyst for those who stay to work for their community and shape it for the better.Over the last several years, we have purchased selected parcels of land near us; not for investment but as a private renewal effort. Dilapidated buildings that could not be remodeled economically were torn down. We developed a parking mall south of our headquarters building.Recently, our bank made another investment decision which will contribute further to the stability of the near west side. We will purchase over $1 million in industrial revenue bonds to finance the construction of a 30,000 square foot facility for an industrial pump manufacturer. The city's Economic Development Commission is sponsoring the revenue bond funding.The use of industrial revenue bonds can be an invaluable tool in promulgating inner city revitalization.The turnaround in this urban renewal process is being supported by capital resources from outside the immediate community. A consortium of banks will provide over $200 million to finance the construction of a residential development for more than 12,000 people.Bringing industry and people into our area has been most encouraging to local businessmen who decided to stay instead of relocate to the subrubs. Preserving private industry is absolutely vital to revitalizing the business climate.Chicago's best known businessman on the west side began selling Model T Fords here 60 years ago. He watched the area begin to decline some 25 years ago but decided to remain, confident in the long-range future. A candy manufacturer who has been headquartered here since 1950 has made some $500,000 in plant improvements in recent years.Their commitment has been supported by an active area organization of businessmen known as the West Central Association. It was organized in 1926 to foster the interests of those having business, residential, and financial interest in the area.An area association such as the WCA typifies a simple philosophy that has been at work here. Business is not an island. Nor is city government.Business cannot exist without its customers, without its suppliers, without a location, nor without the community surrounding it. Government cannot exist without businesses both large and small.We must all work together on a fair and equitable basis for any of us to exist. It seems that from day to day, many of us forget these principles. But when we each look at our area of operation and responsibility, it becomes mandatory that we trust in all facets of the community, and work together if we are to be successful.An area association should strive to awake in business and government alike the necessity for a strong cooperative effort, so that all may benefit. Our members have found an area association to be the most effective communications vehicle between business and government.By speaking as one voice in the community, the association was able to play a key role in formulating a redevelopment plan for a 288-acre district in our area. The plan, which has the full support of our businessmen, is now awaiting official adoption by the city council.A key element calls for the selective acquisition of properties, retaining those that are basically sound and encouraging the improvement of others where necessary and economically feasible. Only those structures which are beyond help will be removed.We know of no other plan where business and political leaders working together have been able to accomplish so much in so short a time. This is not to suggest that the urban renewal process can be put in a time frame. A more realistic approach is not only to be persistent, but patient, and cooperate to the fullest extent possible with the public sector. This is especially important in urban areas like Chicago, where our political leaders have a multitude of problems and must change their priorities from time to time.The small and medium size businessmen stand to benefit the most from careful planning. Condemnation proceedings can be emotionally devastating, hitting hardest those who can least afford to lose a lifetime commitment and investment to both their business and their community.If your financial institution is in a changing neighborhood, the need for a concerted plan of action should be clear. The local community bank can spearhead the urban renewal process by organizing an area association if you do not have one, or supporting it with the financial resources and the enthusiastic participation needed to carry on its work.Picture, KENNETH A.

"Images, Profit and Regulation-IV",The American Banker,"June 26, 1979, Tuesday","Banks can expect recurring confrontations with consumerists in the next few years and with legislators sensitive to consumer pressure. But the number and severity of such confrontations can be reduced by a more positive approach to legitimate consumer grievances, especially if the financial institutions themselves initiate actions and changes in conformity with community needs.As we saw last time, some bankers suggest jumping on the consumerist bandwagon when the situation warrants it. This, they say, makes good business sense as well as good public relations, since accomodating consumerism means simply that one gives the consumer and the community a better deal. With this approach, one bank president remarked, banks ""can live with consumerism rather than engage in a futile, head-on struggle with it.""That banks can paint themselves into a corner with such ""futile"" struggles, has been demonstrated in conflicts on both the east and west coasts. The California Banking Association, after a bitter battle, successfully beat back a measure forbidding banks that issue credit cards to discriminate or redline by geographical area. But they reaped a more severe political backlash. Not only has the original measure been reintroduced in somewhat more virulent form, but now the Association must also deal with a bill to create a state-owned bank.In New York City, several thrifts were forced into an accomodation with consumerists in the wake of a battle over implementation of the Community Reinvestment Act. And as the bank president quoted above suggests, management not only lives with it, but has learned to like it.The story began when the New York Public Interest Research Group (NYPIRG), a student-based consumerist organization, mounted CRA-related campaigns first in Brooklyn, then the Bronx. When direct approach to management failed, NYPRIG escalated the struggle.Distributing fact sheets which graphically demonstrated the contrast between the huge amount of community funds flowing into the thrifts and the paucity of funds reinvested NYPRIG succeeded in building a large, voluble and angry constituency. Picket lines were organized, posters naming the offending thrifts (as well as praising two with solid reinvestment histories) were placed in local store windows, and thousands of depositors signed pledge cards to close their accounts in banks where management failed to respond. As more and more customers jumped the gun, withdrawing their accounts even before NYPRIG asked them to honor their pledges, several thrifts finally signed reinvestment agreements.This won favorable reaction for those that signed. More to the point was the profitable business the complying banks unearthed when they went into the communities as agreed to seek out creditworthy mortgage and personal loan applicants. As the president of one $1.3 billiondeposit thrift said in an interview after the signing: ""CRA offers new marketing opportunities for banks alert enough to send branch managers into their communities with this objective. And this also helps us project the kind of image that wins friends for the bank and for the industry.""Up to this point, the commercial banks sat on the sidelines as bemused spectators of this struggle. But then the Citibank marketing department awoke to the business and goodwill possibilities offered by all this consumer activity. A representative asked NYPIRG if they could put the bank in touch with loan applicants in the embattled communities. While NYPIRG would not act as ""agent,"" it did organize a forum on community credit needs, inviting Citibank and other commercials to participate.It is still too soon for any statistics on the outcome. But as a Citibank marketing executive remarked: ""Any bank would appreciate the chance to present its case to several hundred credit-worthy prospects ready and anxious to do business."""
EMS: First Step Towards Economic Convergence,The American Banker,"December 14, 1979, Friday","As a member state of the Community, the word domestic no longer means for Britain, for example, the territory contained within the shores of the British Isles -- but rather the whole of the Community of nine, and shortly ten, member states comprising a population of nearly 270 million people. In Community jargon this area is known as the ""internal"" market, or sometimes as the ""single"" market. It could as well be called the domestic market since by and large this is what it already is for trade in goods and what I hope it will become in the field of services, particulary financial services.Progress in the creation of a single market for services has lagged behind our achievement in the free movement of goods. This is not surprising since the difficulties involved are much more intractable and we took longer to begin tackling them. But the discrepancy in progress between the two sectors has become so great that catching up on services should now be a high priority for the Community.Bringing about a banking system for over 250 million people which is at the same time both competitive on fair terms and yet secure for the customer, whether corporate or private, is not an undertaking which can be accomplished overnight. A step by step approach is necessary and in a moment I want to tell you how we are proceeding. But first I want to turn briefly to the immediate context in which we are operating.First of all -- the European Monetary System. The institution of the EMS does not of course constitute the new millennium which is going to solve all our problems. I do believe, however, that it is the start of something important. I shall not rehearse before an audience such as this the arguments in favor of the EMS. I would, however, say that I detect a certain disillusionment with floating rates and at the same time a reluctance to revert for good reasons to a fixed rate system. Though one may argue about the details and the timing, there is a growing consensus that a system which attempts to move simultaneously towards greater stability while retaining sufficient flexibility to accommodate changes in the relative strength of Member currencies is the direction in which we ought to be moving.I say this not simply because I regard currency stability as a good thing in itself, which I do especially as against our experience of the alternative. I also believe it is an essential component of what I regard as now being one of the most important aims of the European Community: namely the coordination of economic policy between the Member States and the Institutions of the Community with the object of bringing about a higher overall level of performance and a closing of the gap between the best and the worst. To use the current jargon, I believe it will help to bring about convergence and on this point I must emphasize that convergence should be towards the standards of the best, not of the worst, performers. You can argue whether the EMS should precede economic convergence or whether economic convergence should precede the EMS. This is an interesting debate, but the important thing is to achieve the aim of getting monetary and economic policy at the Community level to operate in support of one another -- something which, to put it mildly, has not always happened in the past. The Community has decided to start with the EMS. I believe it is very much in the interests of all our Member States that it should succeed in securing this objective.I am sure that Member States will be prepared to make great efforts to maintain and develop the EMS, and it is a source of satisfaction to me that the United Kingdom has now decided to participate in the swap arrangements. I hope this step will lead in the near future to membership of the intervention currency mechanism as well.All this, of course, is relevant to the development of banking policy in the Community. Greater monetary stability will provide a more favorable climate for increased cross frontier investment, which should bring in its train increased capital movements. Greater freedom of capital movement -- and in this context I greatly welcome the recent liberalization by the British Government which I regard as good both for Britain and the European Community -- must inevitably have certain consequences for those concerned with the prudential aspects of banking. It is vitally important that greater freedom should not result in lessconfidence. Our steps towards the wider market must not be dogged by banking failures that could have been avoided had there been more efficient supervision.Some in the banking industry may be worried about the implications of this remark. So I hasten to say that we in the Commission do not wish to see bankingshackled with a great apparatus of prudential control at the Community level. But some extension of control is, I would say, self evidently necessary: as banking goes increasingly international so must the supervisors.So far we in the Commission have concentrated our efforts on what we regard as the top priority. That is the creation of an adequate and reasonably uniform system of supervision for all banks operating in Europe, irrespective of their state of origin, in the interests both of the banks themselves (in the sense that we do not wish to see any bank at a competitive disadvantage) and of their depositors (who need to be guaranteed that certain minimum standards of prudence are being met).Our starting point is the First Directive in the field of credit institutions or, to give it its full title, the First Council Directive on the coordination of laws, regulations, and administrative provisions relating to the taking up and pursuit of the business of credit institutions. I will not go into detail about the provisions of this Directive -- I imagine most of you are familiar with its broad outline -- and for my purposes today I think it will be sufficient for me to remind you that the First Coordination Directive has two main aspects. In the first place, it requires the setting-up of a basic licensing procedure for all banks within the Community, and in the second place -- and this will prove to be its more important aspect -- it looks to the future, not in the sense that it prescribes specific tasks to be carried out at some future date in the coordination of banking legislation, but in that it attempts to create the machinery for the identification and implementation of such tasks.It is on this second aspect that I should like to dwell because I believe its implications for the creation of a single domestic market in Europe to be very considerable.There are two types of machinery proposed in the Directive -- one formal, one informal. The latter is to be found in Article 7 of the First Coordination Directive which calls upon the banking supervisory authorities of the Member States to ""collaborate closely in order to supervise the activities of credit institutions operating in one or more Member States."" There are several reasons which prompted the inclusion of this Article. First, in order to avoid unnecessary and wasteful duplication of effort in the supervision of credit institutions, we are promoting the principle of home country control. In other words, as banks branch into other Member States, we wish their home supervisory authorities to be able to follow them, since as I have already argued only in this way can they obtain the overall view which is so essential if they are to do their job properly. This procedure will obviously require close cooperation among control authorities. Indeed, willing and close cooperation is nothing short of critical to the success of the Commission's approach.Secondly, despite what some of our critics may say, we do not in the European Commission believe in legislation for its own sake. In the field of banking, we learned this lesson early on. As some of you may recall, our first attempt at a banking coordination directive set out to harmonize in one go the various legal provisions governing banking in the Member States. To put it at its best, this attempt met with a mixed reception. Now we opt for a more pragmatic approach, and rightly so, I think: much better a system of close cooperation between national supervisory authorities imposing a minimum number of legal requirements and solving problems as they arise than the lengthly and complex route of institutional harmonization. Thirdly, this process of cooperation between supervisory authorities has an important part to play in the general coming together of Community countries and of their institutions. The benefits from this may be less tangible in the short term, but they are real nonetheless and will become increasingly valuable as time goes on.The other and more formal type of machinery which the First Coordination Directive proposes is contained in Article 11, which deals with the formation of an ""Advisory Committee of the Competent Authorities of the Member States of the European Economic Community."" This again involves national supervisory authorities but officials serving on the Advisory Committee do so not in their national capacity but as members of a European body which has been created by the First Coordination Directive and charged with specific tasks under that Directive. The Committee is to work alongside the Commission and has three maintasks alloted to it: that of assisting the Commisssion in ensuring the proper implementation both of the First Coordination Directive and, in so far as it relates to credit institutions, of a Directive adopted in 1973 on the abolition of restrictions on the freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide services;that of carrying out other tasks prescribed by the First Coordination Directive, an example of which would be the overseeing of the so-called observation ratios which are to be established for the purposes of monitoring the solvency and liquidity of credit institutions; andthat of helping the Commission prepare new proposals to the Council of Ministers concerning further coordination in the sphere of credit institutions --here, may well be the Advisory Committee's most useful contribution to building a truly European framework within which banks may operate.I should clarify here that despite this fairly technical-sounding brief it is not intended that the Advisory Committee should preoccupy itself with details. Its function is much more advice on policy formulation within which the more detailed technical aspects can then be worked out. It meets once or twice a year only. Its first meeting confirmed our expectations that this Committee will serve as a useful forum for concrete and constructive discussion between the Commission and the Member States.I referred earlier on to apprehension sometimes encountered in banking circles at the prospect of consolidated supervisory control. As I indicated, I think that it is an inevitable trend and one which need not give rise to anxiety. Indeed it has its advantages for banks. It would, for instance, permit centralized bookkeeping leading eventually in a single banking market to a situation in which deficits of liquidity in one Member State could be offset against surpluses in another -- a facility certainly not available at the moment. In such a situation the present requirement for separate capital to be hived off for every foreign branch, each of which in turn has to conform to different local solvency and liquidity ratios, would also be removed. One of the most important first steps down this road will be getting agreement on the principle in all the Member States of consolidated accounts and then the enactment of appropriate legislation. My impression is that the principle is now generally accepted. I agree with the Governor of the Bank of England when he said that consolidated global balance sheets would be a major step forward in the ability of supervisors to assess any risks being run in international banking. I therefore regard it as a matter of priority that the Commission should produce a legislative proposal to send to the Council at an early date. There are several difficult problems to be solved over bank accounts, and adoption of legislation in this area will be an important achievement for the Community enabling us to speed up work on other related issues.Before closing, I want briefly to mention the Eurocurrency market. This is an essential element in international borrowing and lending, as its ability to cope with the excessive international liquidity which followed the oil price rise of the early 1970s testifies. There is in my view no necessary antagonism between the Eurocurrency market and the domestic market -- indeed, they have different functions which complement one another. But the increasing concern that is being expressed from both the monetary and, to a lesser extent, prudential point of view about the present state of the Eurocurrency market cannot be ignored.Various remedies of greater or lesser severity are being suggested to deal with the situation. In my view, sensible and timely prudential measures are likely to preserve in existence a relatively unfettered Eurocurrency market. And of one thing I am convinced -- more information about the market is needed. The Commission is not at present planning specific prudential measures in relation to the Eurocurrency market. Equally, we cannot ignore its existence. The impact of the proposals which we shall bring forward on consolidated accounts will naturally extend to the Euromarket and will be a useful first step towards greater transparency of it.In developing a Community banking policy, therefore, we seek to open up and unify a market that is still fragmented and do so in a manner which ensures that competitive conditions are fair.Fair does not mean identical. We are not seeking, as I hope I have convinced you, massive harmonization. But fair means a reasonable overall balance of advantage for those operating in the market. Our approach is minimalist. We are content with less rather than more legislation and look to cooperation between existing national supervisory authorities rather than to the creation of new institutions. The rule of the market will still be caveat emptor. The Commission is not in business to do away with risk. Equally there must be reasonable security for the investor. Exactly how this security is achieved can and indeed will to a considerable extent be influenced by the responsibility shown by the banking industry itself. In the creation of a single European market for banking, the European Commission has sought and received the constructive cooperation of the European banking industry. We regard it as essential that this should continue and be reinforced as we get down to tackling some of the difficult issues, both technically and politically, that will have to be resolved. That we will solve them, I am equally convinced. Our aim, as I said at the outset, is to bring the development of the common market in services into line with progress in trade in goods -- a development from which the whole Community will derive benefit."
Nebraska BA Educational Project Traces Banks' Role in State's Economic Growth,The American Banker,"October 8, 1979, Monday","The project, entitled ""The Desert Shall . . . Blossom as the Rose,"" was developed for the association by Nebraska historian Robert Manley.It traces the economic history of the state, and a dominant theme of the project is the role the state's banks have played in Nebraska's economic growth.Because of that emphasis, banks are being given the first opportunity to provide the project to their communities.The project comes in a kit containing a three-part filmstrip series, with accompanying audio cassettes, plus a workbook for teachers and worksheets outlining several possible student projects.It is ideally suited for junior and senior high school social science, history or economic classes, Mr. Manley said. The project could used individually to supplement an existing course curriculum.In addition to use in a community's school system, the project also lends itself to presentations before youth and adult service and civic organizations, according to Dave Simmons of Fremont National Bank, chairman of the NBA subcommittee which worked with Mr. Manley on development of the project.""We feel the wide variety of potential audiences for this project will result in some broad public relations benefits for the sponsoring banks,"" Mr. Simmons said. ""In towns where banks share the cost of sponsoring the project for their community, each participating bank can realize the same public relations benefits.""To help banks realize maximum benefits from sponsorship, NBA has prepared a booklet outlining suggested uses of the project and tips on how to implement these suggestions, Mr. Simmons explained.These booklets will be provided to banks ordering kits at no extra charge.According to Mr. Manley, similar educational kits on the market today retail for $100 or more. Nebraska banks are being given first opportunity to purchase the kits for their community at a cost of only $40 per kit.Mr. Simmons said the banks may want to order more than one kity for a community. Schools may want more than one kit, if several classes plan to utilize the project, plus the banl may want to keep its own kit for other uses around the city.Bankers should be aware, Mr. Simmons explained, that each kit contained one set of materials. Replacement parts for any of the kit's material will be available.The workbook and worksheets contained in the kit are designed for teacher's use, he explained, and those materials are not required for each student.Extra workbooks for teachers could be made available, he explained, and the worksheets are such that they can be photocopied if extra sets are needed.Mr. Simmons said that Mr. Manley will be available to meet with local school officials and teachers to explain the project.Brochures and order forms have been mailed to NBA member banks."
Mutual Donating to Bronx Children's Day,The American Banker,"April 30, 1979, Monday","The event, scheduled for May 20, is sponsored by the Bronx Council for the Advocacy of Children and Youth.The BCACY, a volunteer organization of professionals from child-care-related agencies in the borough, has organized a day-long series of activities for children. A children's parade along the Grand Concourse to the County Courthouse will end with exhibits and entertainment at Joyce Kilmer Park. Groups from the Bronx and throughout the city are joining in the effort, BCACYT president George Laurence noted.Bronx borough president Stanley Simon is honorary chairman of the program.As part of its support for the program, Eastern Savings will furnish a mobile band organ for the parade and shirts for the children running in a minimarathon race that will be held in conjunction with other activities, Mr. Goldstein said. In addition, the mutual is supplying assistance to the BCACY in such areas as printing and promotion, he said.Eastern Savings earlier this year was given the first We Care Award by the Bronx Chamber of Commerce.Eastern Savings, operating five offices in the borough, has undertaken many community projects, including the city's first senior citizen olympics, which was held last year at Bronx Community College and which the savings bank will fund again this year.Groups interested in participating in the Children's Day activities should telephone the BCACY office at 590-3050, Mr. Goldstein said."
New York Bank for Savings Donates Office Building to Harlem Art Museum,The American Banker,"October 29, 1979, Monday","The deed to the five-story building was presented this month at ceremonies held during a reception at the Harlem State Office Building. Officials from the bank, museum and community representatives attended the event. The Studio Museum in Harlem, long an integral part of the community's cultural life, has been seeking a new location where it can expand the services it presently provides. It has been located at 2033 Fifth Avenue, between 125th and 126th Sts.Upon receiving the news that the board of trustees of the New York Bank For Savings had voted to donate its building at 144 West 125th St. to Studio Museum, richard Clarke, The Museum's chairman of the board of trustees said, 'Mr. Arthur J. Quinn and his board if trustees have etched their names into the history of this community by their generous example of corporate social responsibility, with this gift we have a mandate to build a major American Museum and that it exactly what we are going to do"".From 10,000 square feet of rented loft space on Fifth Avenue, above a row of commercial outlets, the museum will move to a 60,000 square foot permanent facility in the heart of the historic district of Central Harlem. In moving to permanent quarters on 125th Street, Studio Museum, referred to by one major foundation as ""the principle center for the study of Black art in America,"" will take its place among the major museums in this country.In addition, the rehabilitation of the half-vacant commercial building and its conversion into a museum facility will join serveral other redevelopment projects to complement the revitalization of 125th Street.The New York Bank For Savings, the bank that pioneered mutual savings in the State of New York in 1819, has held the mortgage of the Kenwood Building for some time. On learning of the museum's futile efforts to locate to a new home, the bank's trustees decided to donate the building as a viable contribution to the Harlem community.The bank has long been interested in improving the housing welfare of the Harlem community, and of other disadvantaged areas of the City of New York.""We hope that this donation of the Kenwood Office Building will serve to inspire other institutions to continue to contribute to the vitality of such communities as Harlem,"" said Arthur J. Quinn, chairman of the bank.The bank, which has an office as 135th Street and Leonx Avenue, has long been involved with new and rehabilitated housing in Central and East Harlem, including such buildings as the UPACA Houses, the Alfred Mills Houses, the Bethel Houses and the Landmark Dunbar Apartments.Last Year the bank was honored by Webb & Brooker, a real estate management firm that has the Kenwood Building under its management among others. Mr. Quinn was among the honorees as Webb & Brooker marked its 10th year of operation.The Studio Museum of Harlem collects, preserves and exhibits the material culture of the African presence in the New World and the products of Black American artists.The Kenwood Office Building has as tenants such diverse organizations as the Visiting Nurse Service of New York, Harlem Education program, Harlem Service Center of the American Red Cross, Women of the American Red Cross, Women In Community Services, Central Harlem Association for Progress, Harlem legal Services, New York Branch NAACP, and Triboro Real Estate Association.The five-story Kenwood Building carries a mortage of $1.5 billion.The director the musem is Mary Schmidt Campbell.""The New York Bank for Savings' donation is the most important contribution in the museum's 11-year history,"" said Ms. Campbell. ""So much of the Black contribution to the arts has been lost because it has never been collected, never been preserved or interpreted. With a permanent facility we can build a permanent collection and an archives for research and study of that art.""The acquisition of the building will also help broaden the museum's financial base. Already, the Harlem Urban Development Corporation is committeed to redesigning the facade in accordance with their facade improvement efforts for West 125th Street.The Museum plans to develop a number of commercial outlets in the new facility, including a gift shop, print and frame shop, a snack shop and gallery.The donation also leaves the museum extremely competitive for funds from Housing and Urban Development as part of HUD's neighborhood revitalization effort. The museum, now that it has a permanent home also hopes to step up its appeal to private foundations and corporations."
Groups Hit Approval of Dime Merger,The American Banker,"July 27, 1979, Friday","After about nine months of study, Superintendent Muriel Siebert approved on July 13 the merger of the $4.1 billion-deposit Dime and the $256.1 million-deposit Mechanics Exchange Savings Bank, Albany, on July 13. The FDIC approved the merger on July 16.The New York Public Interest Research Group, Inc., and Bank on Brooklyn, which are related organizations, said this week that they had documented failure of the Dime to bear its share of local lending with evidence that most loans made in downtown Brooklyn brownstone neighborhoods were issued by nonbank lenders.They added: ""The Dime's record is worse than most other institutions relative to its asset size.""Thomas N. Rothschild, chairperson of the downtown chapter of Bank on Brooklyn, said that ""the Superintendent has condoned or approved outright every excuse the Dime offered for not lending in its own backyard."" By backyard, he meant the fact that Dime's main office is in downtown Brooklyn.In her decision, the Superintendent noted that the Dime's performance in downtown Brooklyn was not as good as its record for Brooklyn as a whole, but she pointed out that the bank has concentrated its branches, deposit-taking and lending in the southern and central sections of Brooklyn.The regulator also said that when she considers the Dime's performance under the state CRA in connection with a future application, she ""will expect"" Dime to have taken these actions: establish within 90 days a division of community affairs; reduce to 30 days its average processing time on mortgage applications and submit reports every 60 days starting Sept. 9 about applications filed, approved and denied; and submit to the Banking Department within 90 days an analysis of the feasibility of expanding its community in the Albany area.In a press release, the groups said the Dime issued only seven mortgages on downtown Brooklyn properties in the first nine months of 1978. A Dime official replied Thursday that this statement was wholly inaccurate. In downtonw Brooklyn in all of 1978, he said, the bank made 74 residential mortgages worth $2.4 million, and closed and committed mortgages worth $4.7 million on commercial property.Janet Hatcher, a member of the board of the Southeast Queens Anti-Redlining Coalition, said the coalition was dissatisfied that the Dime application was approved but was pleased with the conditions attached, though she said they could have been much stronger."
President's Panel on Neighborhoods Recommends Strengthening of CRA,The American Banker,"March 23, 1979, Friday","The commission suggested that financial institutions be prohibited from denying loans or setting terms on such bases and said this should apply to multifamily rental unit loans, small business loans and other community development loans, as well as home loans and home improvement loans.The commission also suggested that legislation should be enacted to make permanent the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and that prepurchase and default counseling be made mandatory for all applicants and mortgagors for loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration.The chairman of the commission, Joseph F. Timilty, urged a national neighborhood policy and the group's report asserted that big-city neighborhoods have become ""less developed countries inside the United States,"" faced with further decline if cuts are made in government spending for social services.The report emphasized, however, that the commission was not calling for massive new expenditures. Rather, it said it was calling for a targeting of existing moneys and a redirection of present programs.Mr. Timilty said that neighborhoods ""have not been merely neglected, they have been the outright victims of national policies. Housing and highway programs have bypassed or bisected them, and suburban growth and exclusionary zoning have left them overburdened, overtaxed and underserviced.""He added that, ""most of all, racial and economic discrimination continued to divide America.""The Commission on Neighborhoods is a 15-month study group with 20 members, of whom 16 were appointed by the President and four are members of Congress.The commission sponsored research, reviewed current research and conduted public hearings in six cities -- Baltimore, Cleveland, St. Louis, Chicago, Los Angeles and Seattle.Among its other recommendations were calls for a ""community full employment strategy"" at all levels of government, a more accurate 1980 census, more financial support for civil rights regulatory agencies, and greater tax incentives for neighborhood development efforts.""The commission agrees that controlling inflation is a priority,"" the report said, ""but we insist that the neighborhoods, the cities and the social needs which have been potentially shortchanged should not once again bear the heaviest burden of past Federal mismanagement of the economy.""Members of the commission who dissented from the report are Sen. Jake Garn, R., Utah, John McClaughry, president of the Institute for Liberty and Community, and Robert B. O'Brien Jr., president of the $719.1 million-deposit Carteret Savings & Loan Association, Newark, N.J."
FDIC Denies Greater NY CRA-Protested Branch Bid,The American Banker,"April 25, 1979, Wednesday","An FDIC official disclosed that FDIC chairman Irvine H. Sprague and FDIC director William M. Isaac had voted against the application, while senior deputy comptroller of the currency for operations Joe H. Selby had voted for it. The official said that while the bank had taken positive action since mid-January, when the FDIC met and took no action on the application, there had not been much increase in mortgage originations.In a statement released Tuesday, the FDIC stated, ""The percentage of the bank's current flow of funds which is being committed to mortgages in the Brooklyn area, although increasing, remains at a fairly low level. A continuation of the present trend in performance would indicate that a favorable assessment of the bank's performance under the CRA could be made at some future date, possibly in early 1980.""The Greater New York application has been closely watched as a test case of how the Federal regulatory agencies would apply the CRA. The banking regulatory agencies reported recently that seven CRA-protested applications were pending before them in Washington.In the only other Federal agency decision involving a CRA issue, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board last December conditionally approved an application filed by City Investing Co. of New York to acquire and merge a California savings and loan association. That application was not protested.The Greater New York application was filed about one year ago. It was approved by the New York State Banking Board last Sept. 5.The turndown was a victory for South Brooklyn's Against Investment Discrimination, the principal community group protesting the application. AID chairman Herb Steiner commented that the decision ""put a set of teeth into the CRA"" and added that it would encourage neighborhood groups across the country ""in not tolerating discrimination by their local lending institutions.""Greater New York's president Jerome Maron had no comment about the decision.Meanwhile, Allen Fishbein, attorney with Center for Community Change in Washington, observed that the FDIC decision ""set a standard for lenders in the New York City area"" and showed the ""FDIC was serious about enforcing CRA."" The center is a nonprofit national organization providing community organization providing communit organizations with technical assistance about housing, community development and other matters.The FDIC statement noted that Greater New York had taken a series of positive steps, including advertising contacts with real-estate brokers and meetings with community groups. It found the bank's current lending terms, which AID says are restrictive, as generally competitive with other Brooklyn savings banks.Greater New York, in November, 1977, announced an affirmative action program in which it accepted a target of $25 million annual investment in sound residential mortgage loans in New York City.The FDIC statement said the bank's loans which were closed, committed or in process at yearend 1978 came close to, but did not reach, $25 million. It added that Greater New York has made a sizable purchase of New York City Housing Development Corp. bonds.Since the FDIC's Jan. 10 meeting at which no decision was made on Greater New York's application, the bank has made these policy changes: opened mortgage lending to nondepositors (which it had suspended for about 45 days); reduced the required down-payment on five-to eight-family home mortgage loans from 50% to 25% and 35%; doubled the maximum size of its Federal Housing Administration home improvement loans to $15,000; increased the maximum for all loans from $75,000 to $100,000; and installed a new Mortgage Action Phone in the lobby of at least one branch.On the other hand, the bank's lending criteria, as posted at that branch last month, included nonrefundable appraisal fees of $50 on a one and two-family mortgage application and of $75 on a three-and four-family application.AID, a primarily volunteer group in Park Slope, Brooklyn, with one full-time staff member, said in its protest that the bank had failed to help meet credit needs of residents in its existing service areas in Brooklyn. It also said Greater New York had stifled mortgage orginations in favor of secondary market investments.Mr. Steiner stated: ""No longer can an arrogant financial institution bully its local community.""Mr. Steiner, asked about the bank's five moves since mid-January, said they were ""all steps in the right direction,"" but said a bank which wants to meet local credit needs must have terms which stimulate borrower demand, have a genuine willingness to lend money and employ affirmative marketing. He said the fact the bank had not increased the number of its mortgage origination officers -- the bank has one, he said -- ""was a sign"" the bank did not intend to substantially increase lending.Mr. Steiner said ""CRA is saying you can't sit behind your desk"" and wait for borrowers to come into a bank. Rather, he said, banks were being urged to go out into the neighborhood to really assess credit needs and to ""get involved"" in meeting neighborhood needs where they can. He said he thought the bank would have to show a lengthy track record of at least one year of real neighborhood involvement and lending before winning approval.Meantime, Mr. Fishbein noted that after a bank is out of the mortgage market for a long time, it takes a substantial effort to change perceptions of residents and brokers about its willingness to lend. He said ""aggressive outreach"" and a significant increase in lending were necessary.He added that the bank had not attempted to negotiate a settlement or agreement with AID since an FDIC hearing on the application was held last October. The settlement would have led to the withdrawal of the protest, he said.Mr. Selby was acting for Comptroller of the Currency John G. Heimann, who was out of town."
Agencies Weigh Stipulating Conditions For Granting Some CRA-Protested Plans,The American Banker,"April 2, 1979, Monday","Prior to CRA, the agencies used conditional approvals to a limited extent. While the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. board of directors have given some conditional approvals, they more often have relied on written commitments from banks, for example, to increase capital by specified amounts.Regulators are wary that conditional approvals in CRA cases may be construed to be a type of credit allocation. An FDIC director, William M. Isaac, said in a recent speech that ""we must be decisive in casting unconditional votes for or against applications with CRA implications; approvals conditioned on specific requirements will surely lead us along the path to credit allocation.""One regulator said ""all agencies are struggling with conditional approvals."" A Comptroller official said ""a conditional approach is worth using because it is less punitive and more positive than outright denial."" But another Comptroller official questioned whether conditional denials and approvals are authorized by agency statute.Already there has been one conditional approval. It was granted by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board in December on an application by City Investing Co. of New York to acquire and merge a California savings and loan association.In that case, the agency required that the surviving S&L, Southern California Savings and Loan Association, Beverly Hills, submit a lending-marketing program and CRA statement which were acceptable to the supervisory agent. According to an official of the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco, the acquisition was effected at the end of last year -- but the program when submitted lacked sufficient detail.Another option open to regulators is withholding approval, which was demonstrated in a closely watched test case concerning a branch application by the $1.5 billion-deposit Greater New York Savings Bank, Brooklyn. The board of directors of FDIC took no action when it considered the application on Jan. 10, and the bank subsequently obtained a suspension of action until the last meeting prior to April 30.Meanwhile, the FHLBB is receiving some criticism for long delays in deciding three protested applications filed about eight months ago. The publication Savings and Loan News, in its forthcoming April issue, reports that regulatory delays on such applications are frustrating community groups and financial institutions alike, and may be causing financial institutions to withhold or withdraw applications or to make imprudent concessions to community groups.Anita Miller, an FHLBB member, stated firmly in a recent interview that that agency would not deliberately delay an application in order to pressure an S&L. Asked about the delay, she said the board was ""struggling to get all the facts"" and was handicapped because relatively few examinations under CRA have been conducted thus far.Two of the pending applications are from the $587.4 million-deposit First Federal Savings and Loan Association, Toledo, Ohio, according to a FHLBB official. These applications, protested by the Greater Toledo Housing Coalition, were filed at the local district last June 22 and arrived in Washington Nov. 22.The other application is from DeKalb Federal Savings and Loan Association, Decatur, Ga., and protested by Metro Fair Housing Services. It was filed at the local district July 17 and arrived in Washington Jan. 8.A FHLBB spokesman said that on the average a branch application is approved in 45 days once it reaches Washington. But ""protest for any reason slows down an application,"" an FHLBB official pointed out.The fact of the matter is that the agencies have not yet decided any applications involving a substantive CRA protest since the act became effective in November. The City Investing case was not protested; lending deficiencies were noted in FHLBB exams, according to FHLBB officials.The agencies lack formal policy on protested applications and are deciding them on a case-by-case basis, according to interviews with several regulators at each of the four agencies. It is ""still a groping process,"" an FHLBB official said. An FDIC official observed open-and-shut cases are easy to decide but the tough ones involve banks which have done some lending ""but one questions if it's enough.""Of the seven applications pending before the regulators in Washington, five are protested by community groups and two by financial institutions.In addition, the regulators are watching several significant cases currently at the district level. Sometimes the regulators themselves have initiated special attention on an application -- for example, because of CRA-civil rights violations detected by examiners.At the Comptroller's Office officials are watching an application, currently at the regional office in Dallas, filed by the $62.8 million-deposit Kelly Field National Bank of San Antonio, to move its only office to Leon Valley, a San Antonio suburb.The bank, which serves a moderate-income Mexican-American community, has organized a bank holding company and proposes to start a bank oriented to the Mexican-American community and assisted by a local Mexican-American accountant.Kelly Field sought to relocate the bank in 1977 but its application was denied by the Comptroller. At the time city officials were opposed to the plan. Currently no local person or community group is objecting but five banks in the San Antonio area are opposed on CRA Grounds. Kelly Field originally served mostly military personnel. A hearing on the case was held Dec. 12 in Dallas.In addition, Comptroller officials said a CRA issue could develop ""at our initiative"" at an unnamed bank where unanswered questions in the fair housing area were noted during a CRA exam. A second CRA exam has been conducted since then, they noted.The only CRA-protested application pending at the Comptroller's Office in Washington is one for a branch filed by the $86.2 million-deposit Citizens National Bank, Meridian, Miss., and protested by two banks and an individual.Meanwhile, two CRA-protested applications are pending at the Fed. A holding company application filed by the First National Boston Corp. to acquire the $45.4 million-deposit Southeastern Bank & Trust Co., New Bedford, has been protested by the $87.1 million-deposit First National Bank, New Bedford, primarily on anticompetitive grounds but also on CRA questions.And a merger application by the $389.7 million-deposit Ohio Citizens Trust Co., Toledo, to merge the $27.9 million-deposit Peoples State Bank, Wauseon, is being protested by the Greater Toledo Housing Coalition.The FNB New Bedford protest suggests that criticism under CRA can be leveled just as strongly by competitors as by community groups. It said that the $7.6 billion-deposit First National Bank of Boston has an ""utterly abysmal"" lending record.The brief said that the Boston bank claims to bring money into communities such as New Bedford but in fact it has drained money away through sale of portions of its loans to its subsidiaries, according to Sander A. Rikleen, attorney with Rich, May, Bilodeau and Flaherty, a Boston firm representing FNB New Bedford.The brief contains a table showing that net funds withdrawn through participations from four of FNB Boston's subsidiaries in 1977 totaled $10.3 million while total capital contributions to the subsidiaries totaled $4.74 million, for a net outflow from subsidiaries to FNB Boston of $5.56 million, he said.The brief said that the Boston institution's ability to draw on its affiliates' funds poses a clear danger that the credit needs of local businesses will be subordinated to those of FNB Boston's large corporate and international customers.Meantime, the FHLBB unconditionally approved on March 22 a protested branch application filed last July 19 by Community Federal Savings and Loan Association, Kansas City. Community Federal and the protesting groups, represented by Legal Aid of Western Missouri, signed an agreement last October and the protest was withdrawn.Shortly before the FHLBB approval, Galen Beaufort, attorney with the legal aid group, said the group's clients were unhappy with the delay because the actions promised by the S&L would not begin until its application was approved.He added that he was ""surprised at the power community groups were able to wield under CRA. We didn't expect Community Federal to meet as many demands as they did."" The agreement was reached the night before an FHLBB hearing in Des Moines, he said.The FHLBB set two conditions in its conditional approval involving City Investing and the surviving S&L, Southern California Savings and Loan Association, Beverly Hills.First, it required City and Southern California to adopt board resolutions stipulating that Southern California would submit an affirmative lending and marketing program, with specific plans, proposals and timetables, acceptable to the supervisory agent at the FHLB of San Francisco by Feb. 5.Second, it required the Southern California board to adopt and submit by Feb. 5 a CRA statement acceptable to the agent.An FHLB San Francisco official said the program was submitted by Feb. 5 but the agent ""wanted a little more detail."" The plan was resubmitted March 14 and will be reviewed, he said. The CRA statement was acceptable, he noted.Mrs. Miller, discussing the delay in deciding protested applications, pointed out the agency has processed 300 applications since CRA became effective. Only three involving CRA issues are now outstanding.She said she ""much prefers"" conditional approval to rejection of a protested application. The purpose of CRA, she noted, is to encourage investment in the community. Some regulators feel that sometimes this objective could be served through conditional approval.At the FDIC no CRA-protested applications are pending, except for the temporarily suspended Greater New York application, which is counted as one of seven pending applications.A regulator involved in the Greater New York application said the two directors then on the FDIC board split between denial and conditional denial when it was considered on Jan. 10. Another regulator said the agency made a ""very concerted effort not to tell the bank what to do"" -- a step which could be viewed as credit allocation.The bank, however, clearly drew a message from the FDIC's no-action posture. Since Jan. 10 the bank has opened mortgage lending to nondepositors, a service it had suspended for about 45 days; reduced the required down payment on five- to eight-family home mortgage loans from 50% to 25% and 35%; doubled the maximum size of Federal Housing Administration home improvement loans to $15,000, and increased the maximum for all loans from $75,000 to $100,000.A visitor to the bank's branch at Seventh Ave. and President St., Brooklyn, found these changes since mid-January: a large sign in the front window saying the bank ""stands ready to make sound residential mortgage loans in this community""; a new Mortgage Action Phone in the lobby, and a detailed description of the bank's lending policy and terms. That policy includes a nonrefundable appraisal fee of $50 on a one-to two-family-unit mortgage application and of $75 on three-and four-family, according to the notice in the lobby.The bank also had copies of the CRA statement available on a counter. It recently sent depositors a brochure which described its available loans and concluded, ""The Greater is helping to meet our community's credit needs.""FDIC officials in New York said the following CRA-protested applications are pending in their region:A merger application by the $4.1 billion-deposit Dime Savings Bank of New York, Brooklyn, to merge with the $251.1 million-deposit Mechanics Exchange Savings Bank, Albany; and a branch application by the $792.7 million-deposit Western New York Savings Bank, Buffalo, both protested by the New York Public Interest Research Group, Inc.; branch applications by the $1.4 billion-deposit Franklin Savings Bank of New York and by Greater New York (suspended), both protested by South Brooklyn Against Investment Discrimination; a branch application by the $521.8 million-deposit North Side Savings Bank, the Bronx, protested by the Northwest Bronx Community & Clergy Coalition; a branch relocation sought by the $892 million-deposit East New York Savings Bank, Brooklyn, protested by Bank on Brookly-Crown Heights, and branch application by the $372.6 million-deposit Orange Savings Bank, Livingston, N.J., protested by three financial institutions under CRA.FDIC officials in Chicago said one protested application was pending. That was a branch application filed by the $44.6 million-deposit Bloomfield State Bank, in Indiana, and protested by an individual. None was reported pending at FDIC regional offices in Boston and Philadelphia.Interviews found that several important CRA issues are unresolved apart from conditional approvals.""Regulators are struggling with evaluation of compliance,"" said one regulatory official. ""How and what data will be used? No methodology of analysis has been developed yet.""Regulators interviewed also suggested the long-term focus of CRA may shift from thrifts to commercial banks. ""The reinvestment issue in a political and policy sense is evolving from a housing to an economic development orientation, with a broad interest in harnessing private credit to meet creditworthy urban needs,"" a Comptroller official observed.One thrift regulator said a difficulty in deciding applications of New York State thrifts is the existence for many years of an unrealistic usury ceiling. The regulator said it is hard to know to what extent lending practices have been due to that ceiling and to estimate the level of lending activity which might be expected from those thrifts in the future.Another difficult-to-resolve issue which has surfaced in some applications is ""the practice of rationing credit when not much money is available,"" the regulator said. A 50% down payment requirement on mortgage loans in tight-money times could have an unintended effect of discrimination against women or minorities, the regulator noted.""Lenders must think through the effects of their policy and be able to assure that it is not discriminatory,"" he said."
Activists Seek Redline Data,The American Banker,"November 14, 1979, Wednesday","In addition, ""financial institutions' charters should be subject to periodic review, similar to the process used by the Federal Communications Commission,"" a resolution approved by the 600 delegates attending the annual convention of the National Association of Neighborhoods said.Other resolutions adopted at the weekend session included demands for the ""permanent extension and strengthening of the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, which should be expanded to cover insurance and mortgage companies, and the toughening and close monitoring of the Community Reinvestment Act."" The group also asked for amendment of the Fair Housing Act to include insurance, and that the legislation ""be expanded to prohibit discrimination in the writing, renewal, or rate-setting mechanism based on geographic location or age obstructure.""Bobby McQuade of the Michigan Committee on Law and Housing led the move to strengthen the Community Reinvestment Act. He told a committee meeting that monitoring by the Detroit group of local loans from Michigan National Bank over a three-year period ""found a complete inverse relationship"" between the sections that needed home improvement loans and those which received them.As an example, Mr. McQuade said that homes without plumbing or other basic necessities were less likely to receive loans than those with plumbing.The coalition also developed position papers on issues that transcend regional boundaries, such as housing, community development, energy, jobs, and social services.The five-year-old neighborhood group will use the resolutions as part of its first platform for lobbying in Washington and during the 1980 general elections. The organization, which represents 400 neighborhood groups throughout the country, will not endorse candidates in elections next year, according to executive director Milton Kotler.Instead, he said, it will emphasize voter education on neighborhood issues and voting records of politicians.The Louisville convention took place following 47 regional conventions, Mr. Kotler said."
White House Seeks Bankers' Views on Fed Chief Selection,The American Banker,"July 24, 1979, Tuesday","The effort is to counter fears expressed by bankers Friday that President Carter may pick the next Fed chairman on the basis of how many votes he can generate for the President in 1980. These apprehensions were touched off by what many considered the political flavor of last week's Cabinet shakeup.But by late Friday, White House staffers already were on the phone to banking leaders proposing names and asking for suggestions for the Fed chairmanship.Neither the White House nor bankers would disclose those discussed for the job during these conservations. However, another source said at least four persons from the banking community were on the White House list.These included Bruce K. MacLaury, former president, Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank, and now president of the Brookings Institution; A. Robert Abboud, chairman, First National Bank of Chicago, Robert V. Roosa, partner, Brown Brothers Harriman & Co., New York, and Paul A. Volcker, president, Federal Reserve of New York.One government official said the White House especially seemed interested in testing the response to Mr. MacLaury.It also is known that White House recruiters were asking for suggestions for potential candidates in the business community for the Fed chairmanship.The search for a new Fed Chairman last week after President Carter decided to send G. William Miller to the Treasury to replace W. Michael Blumenthal.The vacancy had a chilling effect on the banking community because many feel the primary theme of the Carter reorganization has been political, and that if the President followed through on the this he likely would select a Fed nominee intended to please a particular voting bloc, rather than picking the best man for the job.Concern was for the impact this might have on international markets as well as the traditional belief that the Federal Reserve must be insulated from politics.White House staff members willing to discuss the subject stressed there was no chance this could happen.""Even from a political point of view, it would be disastrous,"" one staff member said, because of the effect it would have on international markets.""We have to find someone who is instantly credible,"" another source said.Some bankers are worried that the administration might have a tough time getting a high caliber candidate to serve on the Fed because of the turmoil of last week, and the effect it could have on the President's chances for reelection.Others stressed that the new chairman should have Central Bank experience because of the feeling that lack of this in Mr. Miller's background resulted in the weakening of some Fed institutions.White House recruiters did not feel either of these would be a problem."
"Bank Lines, Placement",The American Banker,"January 4, 1979, Thursday","Prior to the restructuring, $113.7 million of the loans were payable in installments beginning Dec 31, 1981, with final maturity on Dec. 31, 1981. The restructuring will stretch the repayment of the loans and reduce the interest for 1978 from $5.3 million to $3.1 million.The two original loans will be replaced by the following credit agreements:Pinehurst, Inc., a Diamondhead subsidiary, will receive $40 million due December, 1983, at 4% interest, with added interest payments equaling 50% of Pinehurst's net income up to a maximum of an additional 4% interest.The community development subsidiary will also receive $12 million secured by the Pinehurst resort, payable at 10% over five years but based on a 20-year amortization. The subsidiary will receive a $21 million, five-year revolving credit secured by accounts receivable at Pinehurst at an interest rate of 8%, increasing 1.4% each year to a maximum of 9%.Lake Forest, Inc., a subsidiary with a community development in Mobile, Ala., will pay 10% on a $10 million loan with interest payable in monthly installments and the principal due in Dec. 1981. The loan is guaranteed by M. P. MacLean, a major Diamondhead stockholder.The parent company will be given a $2.1 million loan payable at 10% in December, 1980.In addition to the new loan agreements, the debt restructuring calls for the sale of $30.7 million of Diamondhead's accounts receivables to the banks at face value.The seven banks joining Citibank in the agreement are Chase Manhattan NA, First National Bank, Chicago, First Pennsylvania Bank NA, Wells Fargo Bank NA, Crocker National Bank, Wachovia Bank & Trust NA, and First National State Bank, New-ark, N.J.Diamondhead and its subsidiaries have six active and one inactive community developments throughout the South."
"Stadium Bank, KC, Adopts New Marketing Stance to Meet Needs of Inner-city Area",The American Banker,"January 30, 1979, Tuesday","While Stadium, formerly Southeast Bank, completed moving to its present location adjacent to the Kansas City Sports Complex a few years ago, the area's population has changed in recent years from 85% white to 95% black.And the bank found many of its new customers did not really understand how to use their bank to their best advantage, W.N. Newby, vice president said.""We discovered that such things as how to figure how much money is in the checking account, how to write a check properly, how to apply for a loan or how to use a major credit card like Visa or Master Charge were all mysteries to many of these people,"" Mr. Newby explained.The bank's first step was to ask customers to fill out a survey seeking their opinions on topics ranging from an allblack staff to conditions of the 26-yearold bank building to whether they considered the neighborhood a dangerous place.Stadium's president and chairman of the board, Jerry H. Green, appointed Dorothy B. Clark, a masters in business administration student at the University of Missouri-Kansas City, assistant to the president and put her in charge of a new educational and advertising program.""We found that our customers were using savings accounts like checking accounts,"" Ms. Clark said. ""We realized that our first priority had to be to educate people on how to use the bank. And we started educational advertisements to help teach them.""In an effort to reach its customers, the bank began a series of quarter-page advertisements in the Call, a weekly newspaper serving the black community here.The advertisements contained such tips as: ""Read the Thursday papers with a scissors ready. Clip money-saving coupons from weekend food ads;"" and ""When you get your raise or bonus, pretend you didn't, and add to your savings.""The ads also explained the difference between a regular savings account that earns 5% interest and a certificate of deposit that earns higher interest if left untouched for a certain period of time.The bank also invited area ministers, considered to be opinion-leaders for the community, to a breakfast to introduce them to the marketing program.""We want them to get involved by disseminating information and to do workshops in the churches. The bank plans to make the mezzanine area in the bank a community meeting room for educational workshops,"" Ms. Clark said.""We want our customers to know they can mail their checks in, that we will handle their Social Security checks and we will pay their bills while they're on vacation, that we can set up retirement programs for them and find ways to earn better interest on their savings,"" she added.One of the bank's more unusual marketing efforts comes in its ""adoption"" of a nearby elementary school. Working with the Kansas City school district and parents and teachers at he school, Stadium is setting up ""Micro City,"" a collection of businesses and services that students will learn to operate in a simplified way.In one class, a savings account program has been started with students bringing in as little as a penny, Ms. Clark said. ""We have student tellers and they will use the math skills they're learningin school to handle the accounts.""All of the officers are involved in the program, but as Ms. Clark explained, ""We're a small bank with total assets of $25 million so it is not possible for all of us to get out in the community and visit every school in the inner city. We're hoping that the big banks like Commerce Bank of Kansas City and others will take notice. We want to get our program going and then go to them and be able to explain that our expenses are mostly in personnel, advice and time.""In addition to the educational aspect of the marketing effort, Ms. Clark noted image-building is an important goal. The customer survey told the bank that the bank manager should have a private office rather than sit in an open area near the lobby. A private office is now being built.The bank will do some remodeling as suggested by the survey, and when it is completed by late January, A COMMUNITY open house will be held.The Sept. 30 statement of condition of Stadium Southeast Bank showed loans of $11.9 million, government securities of $8.8 million, deposits of $22.5 million, capital and surplus of $2.5 million and total assets of $25.8 million."
Successful Marketing Combines the Traditional and Innovative Approaches,The American Banker,"August 13, 1979, Monday","It is akin to the person placed on a strict diet and looking at all the things he cannot eat. Perhaps he really should be thinking of all the imaginative menu possibilities that can be prepared with what he is permitted to eat.That may sound like a simplistic analogy; however, that is what it amounts to in an industry as highly regulated and competitive as ours. Now, we not only have to find products and services that will sell, but we must, through the Community Reinvestment Act, show that the product is needed and our overall operation is beneficial to all segments of the society.At Northwestern National Bank of Minneapolis, we have developed a marketing system that has proved effective for our growth needs and our commitment to the community. We have combined the traditional approach with what we like to consider as innovative.On the traditional side, take the recent Federal Reserve Board's decision to allow a new instrument, the Treasury security certificate, also know as a floating rate certificate. This allows banks to offer savings certificates for four years or more with a monthly fluctuating interest rate based on the going rate at the time.Like other banks, we have developed and now offer such an instrument. Our marketing division, run by senior vice president Paul M. Eisen, performed an exhaustive profit analysis. The marketing division's study also showed that deposits under $500 would lose money for the bank. However, we decided to go ahead with a minimum deposit of $300, despite the fact that such an account would cost us. That is not a traditional approach in banking or any other business.In the long run, the floating rate certificate is going to make money for us, because there will be enough accounts above $500 to offset the losses from smaller amounts. Such a decision permits us to serve both ends of the savings community as well as that vast group in between.We went a step further by not including an interest penalty upon the death of the holder. The law gives us the option to impose the penalty if we choose, but we elected not to as a way of providing another customer benefit. This allows us to offer the elderly investor a piece of the action. Again, this may not seem fiscally sound, but from a volume and actuarial viewpoint, we will make a fair profit.As we develop new products and services, we should be mindful that some customers purposefully reject technology. The traditional products and services meet their needs just fine, and we must find ways to continue to offer them.There are also other ways of combining the traditional with the new. Passbook savings accounts are going by the wayside nationally, being replaced by quarterly statements processed by computers. We have adopted this system but, at the same time, realized that many of our customers prefer a passbook account. To satisfy their needs we continue to offer that service -- and 11% of our customers opt for it.In making our marketing decisions we use all of the sophisticated methods available to us: in-depth interviews; random sampling surveys; mass mailings; selective mailings and others.In some instances we do exactly what our studies say we should not do, all immediate profit instincts aside. For example, take the placement of instant cash machines. To make the automatic tellers justifiable, we need 6,000-7,000 transactions on each machine per month. We deliberately placed one at our North American office on Minneapolis's near north side, knowing full well we would not make a profit on it. The office serves a predominantly poor neighborhood, unsophisticated in banking knowledge. The machine averages only 2,000 transactions per month. But it serves a good purpose -- it helps those who do use it, and it acts as a tool to train other customers in the ways of modern business.There is more to marketing than a department designed as such. Our consumer banking division (formerly known as personal banking) serves as an ear for marketing. The consumer banking staff is frequently the first to learn of the needs of the customer.James A. Gossen, vice president of consumer banking, recalls a prime example of how the on-line staff can be of help to marketing.About three years ago, members of his staff reported queries from senior citizens about developing a special package for the elderly. Mr. Gossen told Mr Eisen, whose department then investigated the matter and conducted interviews with elderly banking customers to find out just what they wanted. The result was a package consisting of free checking for savings customers, $3 coupons for safe deposit rental, free traveler's checks, cashier's checks and notary public service. Of the 7,000 customers 60 years or older subscribing to the package, about 10% are new accounts.Mr. Gossen's department also has been responsible for refinements of existing services, miniscule changes that can play an important part in marketing. For instance, our bank policy on cashiers' checks had required a separate form for each check. If a customer wanted 10 checks, it required 10 forms -- delay and frustration for both the customer and the teller. The marketing division came up with one form to handle multiple cashier's check orders.Early in 1977 we took a marketing step that turned out to be unique in the industry. We established the position of customer rights officer. He serves an ombudsman to the customer, cutting across red tape to investigate complaints. What he sees are the hard core problems. But he also notices the trends indicating a need for a marketing refinement, or an entirely new product or service. His quarterly reports are reviewed thoroughly by Mr. Eisen's marketing division.There is more to marketing, however, than the bold approach. There are even ways to turn government intervention into a useful tool. A case in point is the Community Reinvestment Act, which requires banks to file annually a report to show how we served our entire marketing constituency. Among other things, it was designed to show that we aren't redlining, the banking equivalent to political gerrymandering. And the CRA file must be made available to the public. It is much like the Federal Communications Commission requirements for radio and television stations -- prove you're serving the community.When the CRA was first introduced, we squirmed and lamented its passage, figuring it was merely more government intervention that would cause us nothing but a huge bureaucratic pile of unnecessary paperwork. But, we examined it and our operation, and discovered that we were already fulfilling the reason for the creation of the CRA. Our only problem was that we weren't promoting our efforts. We had not told anybody who was interested that we, indeed, try to serve the entire community.So, we turned the CRA file into a marketing tool. We take the file and a special audio-visual presentation to the people -- all aspects of the community. And we solicit information: what can we do to improve our service?There is an undercurrent to our entire marketing program -- serve the community. Although programs may not be justifiably profitable this year, they will be in the long run. Our philosophy is that a bank is only as good as the community it serves.Picture, JOHN A. McHUGH"
US Bancorp Slates Bank Acquisition,The American Banker,"November 27, 1979, Tuesday","It is the third Oregon bank holding company to announce plans this year to acquire an additional bank as a separate subsidiary, in what some here see as a trend of larger banks recognizing the importance of maintaining the acquired bank's strong community identity.The verbal agreement calls for the exchange of 1.25 shares of U.S. Bancorp stock for each of 180,000 shares of Forest Grove stock outstanding, a transaction whose value is estimated to be about $6 million. The agreement is subject to execution of a definite agreement, and the approval of directors, shareholders, and regulatory authorities.The Forest Grove bank, which has two branches, was established in 1907, and the only other bank in the community ----First National Bank of Oregon, Portland.In announcing the verbal agreement, a spokesman for U.S. Bancorp hinted the holding company may seek further bank acquisitions between now and 1984, when the state's home office protection law expires.The home office law was repealed in this year's session of the Oregon Legislature, but a transition time prior to expiration was included in the repeal. The law prohibits a bank from establishing a de novo branch in any community of under 50,000 population if another bank has a head office there. Under the law, U.S. National Bank could not have established a branch in Forest Grove. However, the law would not have prevented U.S. Bancorp from acquiring the Forest Grove bank and merging it into U.S. National.Earlier this year, Orbanco, holding company for the Oregon Bank, Portland, acquired banks in Lincoln City and Grants Pass and announced it would operate them as separate subsidiaries. First State Bank of Oregon is in the process of acquiring, as separate subsidiaries, banks in Hood River and McMinnville."
Boston Mutual Faces New CRA Test,The American Banker,"October 29, 1979, Monday","The $934.9 million-deposit Provident Institution for Savings will be challenged by the Massachusetts urban Reinvestment Advisory Board under provisions of the Federal Community Reinvestment Act.James Carras, executive director of MURAB, said he believes this is the first time the CRA guidelines will be used to dispute a bank's right to branch. Provident now has five branches in downtown Boston and one in suburban Saugus, and according to vice-president William Maytum, has chosen Newton because ""we have a lot of customers there and want to make it convenient for them.""That, ironically, is part of the basis on which MURAB will, at a Nov. 13 hearing before state Banking Commissioner Gerald Mulligan, challenge the application.According to Mr. Carras, Provident has not met the guidelines of CRA which require a bank to prove it has met community needs in its own neighborhood before seeking to branch out. He said that Provident ""has a very low percentage of assets lent out in mortgages and they export a lot (of money) out of state.""Mr. Carras also cited the rejection of the same Provident application last year by then Banking Commissioner Carol Greenwald, who, in a detailed letter, stated the bank's record ""is not impressive. Affirmative lending in its community appears to be secondary to deposit growth.""In that denial, Ms. Greenwald cited a low loan-to-asset ratio, too many Federally insured mortgages, a nonrefundable mortgage application fee, a dearth of student loans, and a ""poor record"" before the Boston Mortgage Review Board, which examines rejected mortgage applications, as other reasons.Mr. Maytum said the bank is not ready to respond specifically to MURAB since that board has not yet presented a formal challenge to Mr. Mulligan. He said ""anybody can challenge this . . . but they have to prove it.""""We have a lot of customers in Newton,"" Mr. Maytum said. Mr. Carras also said that only five members on the 38-person board of the mutually owned institution live in Boston, (""All in expensive neighbourhoods"") and that only one is a woman, as other reasons the application will be challenged.Banking sources say there is a lot of political resentment involved in this case too. The Newton-based Mutual Bank for Savings, a growing $500.1 million-deposit institution, last year opened a downtown Boston branch in a move that reportedly irked other banks in the competitive area.Provident's site selection for Newton is very close to Mutual's home headquarters, but that bank has not yet filed any objection, according to Mr. Carras.Although the active MURAB has been monitoring bank activities for CRA violations, Mr. Carras said they are ""not going after every bank in the state,"" as he says some similar New York groups have done using the Federal statutes.He said Provident was selected because ""they are probably the worst in terms of neighborhood lending and they have been very uncooperative.""Mr. Carras added that the bank in the past two years has contributed less than $3,000 to the Neighborhood Housing Service, a consortium of community groups, banks and city officials trying to provide revitalization money, despite being asked for more than $20,000."

NPA Unwelcome at ABA Meeting,The American Banker,"August 16, 1979, Thursday","NPA this month warned the ABA leadership it might show up at ABA's annual convention this October in New Orleans to press for a series of demands committing the banking industry to improving its lending record in city neighborhoods, lowering mortgage rates and supporting enforcement of the Community Reinvestment Act.In an Aug. 2 letter to NPA, Willis W. Alexander, ABA executive vice president, said the proper forums for discussing urban problems with community leaders should be a series of workshops held by ABA during the year on topics relating to inner-city redevelopment. ""It is our opinion that participation at such workshops, as recently conducted in St. Louis, brings community leaders together with the bankers who relate more closely with urban neighborhood revitalization,"" wrote Mr. Alexander in the letter sent to Gail Cincotta, NPA chairperson.Those kind of meetings permit ""a greater opportunity for community and banker dialogue,"" said the ABA official, adding that ""it is important to state that it is the intention of this association and its member banks to continue doing their part in restoring and revitalizing America's neighborhoods.""But the ABA board has ""voted no"" on NPA officials addressing the annual convention because ""the convention program has been completed and speakers selected many months prior to"" the group's June request.""It is the board's decision that your participation at the ABA workshops is more productive and beneficial to all parties,"" Mr. Alexander continued.Mr. Alexander noted in his three-page letter that the ABA supports CRA as ""the law of the land"" and is working with regulators and local bankers on compliance.Regarding the lowering of mortgage rates by supporting a fixed national usury ceiling of 8%, Mr. Alexander said the ABA has consistently supported ""reasonable interest rates within the realities of the marketplace.""While it is easy to be for lower interest rates, the reality of the situation is that inflation and monetary policy are pushing in the other direction.""In concluding the letter, Mr. Alexander reminded Ms. Cincotta of what the ABA perceived as discourteous treatment of John H. Perkins, president of the ABA, during NPA's annual convention in Washington in June.Mr. Perkins, also president of the Continental Illinois National Bank & Trust Co., Chicago, had been interrupted during his speech at the NPA annual convention by boos and shouting from the crowd and Mr. Alexander said this kind of reception and an NPA demonstration in ABA's Washington headquarters did not reflect ""a sincere interest in productive dialogue.""ABA remains committed to resuming a ""good faith"" dialogue with NPA, Mr. Alexander said, adding ""it is our hope that you will respect our right to our opinions as we respect your rights.""A copy of Mr. Alexander's letter was sent to all 26 members of the ABA board.The ABA communication to NPA also denied its request for a list of the ABA membership.""It is the association's policy not to make this list available to outside groups or individuals,"" Mr. Alexander wrote."
East NY Eases Local Mortgage Terms,The American Banker,"November 27, 1979, Tuesday","The $892.5 million-deposit thrift institution is reducing its required downpayment from one-third to 25% of appraised value and lengthening the maximum loan term from 20 to 25 years. The loans will be made at a 10 1/4% interest rate, the maximum permitted under New York State's usury law.A spokesman said the move was largely made possible by the bank's success with the loophole accounts, which offers loans to consumers for combination with their savings to meet the $10,000 minimum for a money market certificate.The savings bank was the first institution in New York City to offer the instrument and attracted a considerable amount of ""new money"" during the three weeks it was alone in the marketplace. Now, most of its competitors also offer the account.The less stringent mortgage terms will be made available to depositors of a year's standing in the neighborhood areas around its 12 branches as defined under the Community Reinvestment Act.The spokesman emphasized that the change in lending policy was not a reaction to pressure from community groups, but he said the thrift was aware of ""community concerns"" and would publicize the change through such groups.He added that the savings bank's management was not certain how long it would be able to remain in the market for mortgage loans. The thrift will likely be swamped with mortgage applications because the state's restrictive usury ceiling and the current high rate-tight credit environment have combined to virtually halt most mortgage finance activity here.In a related development, Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. last week also announced a special residential mortgage program with lower downpayments and longer maturities designed to assist low and moderate income neighborhoods in New York.The bank said it had initially allotted $10 million to its new Mortgage Assistance Program. For qualifying individuals, the bank will make loans carrying private mortgage insurance of up to 90% of appraised value or purchase price, whichever is less, for maturities of up to 30 years."
Success of Urban Lending Unit To Spur More Fla. S&L Agencies,The American Banker,"March 30, 1979, Friday","The agency opened in a black neighborhood in October, is separate from the S&L's 20 branches, and is operated by a staff of three. Similar to a loan production office, it takes loan applications, does credit counseling and closes loans. It cannot approve loans or accept savings deposits.The agency, in general, demonstrates First Federal's ""total community involvement,"" according to John Nye, mortgage services coordinator. This involvement is also manifest in a variety of programs carried out in cooperation with the city, the county and the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, he said.As a foundation for that commitment, the S&L has bid for FHLBB funds made available under a national program for urban redevelopment. As a result, First Federal says, it has led the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlantic distric in establishing urban redevelopment programs.In three offerings of Community Investment Funds, First Federal has won a total of $22.5 million, which includes $10 million of the first $100 million offered throughout the FHLB district.The funds may be used for general lending but First Federal has designed a program that commits $5 million of them over the next five years to a specific end.That is a two-pronged program of making loans to low-income families for owner-occupied homes of lower value. For purchase of a new home, a qualifying family may obtain a mortgage loan without paying the three points currently being charged and at the 10% interest rate that is at present the ""prime"" rate for borrowers.For refinancing a home, Mr. Hye explained, the program reduces the interest rate by 1/2 or 1%. The points must be paid.In the first plan, he said, it is important to the low-income family to spread the higher cost by higher payments rather than to face the burden of high initial costs.In a separate project, First Federal has committed $3 million for a three-year period for use in conjunction with a Community Development Housing Rehabilitation Program sponsored by Broward County.The project lends money for first, second and even third mortgages to improve conditions in homes in seven qualifying communities within the county. Mr. Nye said there has been no applicant so far for more than $150,000.A maximum loan is for $10,000 for a maximum term of 12 years at 3% interest to the low-income borrower, a figure that the county subsidizes to the lender at no less than 9 1/2%.The lender gets the full 12 years' subsidized portion of the interest at the outset and collects the 3% over the life of the loan at the outset.""That 12 years' interest up front is like a carrot dangling in front of lenders to encourage them to enter the program,"" Mr. Nye said.The urban lending agency has thus far closed roughly $1 million in loans under all of its programs, and community involvement has extended to other endeavors as well, according to Sue Hughes, a marketing officer.First Federal is participating in an Inner City Scholarship Program, she said, and has begun cooperating with other organizations -- including the Florida Power and Light Co. and local black churches in credit counseling.Because of the success of the program, she said, discussions are under way ""with the idea of going north and south in the county to other neighborhoods, black and white, where there are needs."""
Small-Bank Unit Counters IBAA on Fed,The American Banker,"March 28, 1979, Wednesday","In a voice vote taken to show ABA solidarity, the 200 executives of small banks who were present adopted, apparently unanimously, a floor resolution backing the ABA stand for uniform, voluntary membership in the Federal Reserve System, coupled with payment of interest on the first $10 million of reserve balances held by member institutions.The vote was taken during a panel presentation on Fed membership at the inaugural community bank executive conference sponsored by the community bankers division of the ABA at the Crown Center Hotel.Backers of the resolution argued that the ABA leadership needs a demonstration of loyalty from small banks in the face of an industry split over Fed membership.Two weeks ago the Independent Bankers Association of America, meeting in New Orleans for its annual convention, passed a resolution supporting universal reserve requirements, with reserve exemptions for small banks. The IBAA resolution was adopted on urging of G. William Miller, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.Concern over the extent of Mr. Miller's cooperation with the ABA on the Fed bill occupied a good part of the debate on the membership issue with some executives accusing him of turning a deaf ear to the ABA.Robert W. Renner, chairman of the community bankers division and president of the $33 million-deposit Citizens State Bank, Hartford City, Ind., said that despite a number of meetings by ABA officials with the Fed chairman Mr. Miller does not listen to the ABA position. Mr. Renner argued that the proposal to exempt small banks from reserve requirements is ""a baited trap"" to divide the banking community.""I believe Mr. Miller will listen to us if we prove to him that we in ABA represent the nation's banks,"" declared Jerome L. Chandler, president of the $9 million-deposit Farmers State Bank in Sterling, Kan., and past chairman of the community bankers division.Mr. Chandler said Mr. Miller has tried to solve membership attrition ""his way,"" but if he wants to get the job done he should ""come to us"" to work out a compromise. He added that perhaps a ""Camp David"" meeting will be needed.Mr. Chandler defended the consensus approach used by ABA in a series of leadership conferences as indicative of support from small banks for the association's position.L. A. Johns, president of the $52.8 million-deposit Isabella Bank & Trust Co., Mount Pleasant, Mich., and a past president of the Michigan Bankers Association, told the Fed membership panel that one of ABA's difficulties on the reserve issue has been the trade group's ""wholly responsive"" approach to bills drafted by United States Rep. Henry S. Reuss and Sen. William Proxmire, both D., Wis., and chairmen respectively of the House and Senate Banking committees.Mr. Johns said he was certain Mr. Miller would entertain ABA's legislation more favorably if it contained some provisions sought by the Fed to halt the membership exodus and he advocated the ABA start ""writing its own bill"" on membership.In this way, the Michigan banker asserted, the ABA could get some of the items it wants, particularly on use of sterile reserves to earn income for Fed members.Speaking from the floor, a number of executives voiced their objections to the policy adopted by the Independent Bankers Association of America in New Orleans. Bankers here maintained that their views were representative of banks in their districts.V. S. Marett Jr., president of the $39.7 million-deposit Union State Bank, San Antonio, Tex., said a telephone poll of 89 banks in Texas, conducted after the IBAA convention, found only four in favor of the IBAA position on membership. Mr. Marett said later the poll was conducted at the request of leaders of the Texas Bankers Association, who questioned the concept of mandatory Fed membership.Mr. Marett said a number of Texas banks contended that mandatory membership would permit Washington ""to take away more of our choices.""The resolution supporting the ABA position on membership was offered on the floor by Bryant E. Wackman, president of the $11.5 million-deposit Brooklyn State Bank, Wis.Scheduled to testify on behalf of the ABA Wednesday at a hearing before the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee are Mr. Renner and John H. Perkins, president of the ABA and the $20.8 billion-deposit Continental Illinois National Bank & Trust Co. of Chicago."
Study Finds No Redlining in St. Louis,The American Banker,"July 13, 1979, Friday","Interviews with more than 100 leaders of neighborhood organizations as well as a review of the lending policies of the 27 savings and loan associations in the St. Louis area revealed no evidence of lending discrimination by race, sex or location or age of structures, according to the study's authors.The research effort was headed by Dr. Donald A. Tyree, chairman of the department of finance at the school, and Dr. Frederick C. Yeager. Neighborhood leaders who brought up the subject of redlining were requested to provide information on cases and the person involved.""Only seven cases were provided,"" Dr. Yeager said, ""with identities of the parties involved. Subsequent investigation of the cases found no evidence to support redlining accusations.""The communities leaders, whose organizations represented about 85% of the city's geographical area, generally felt that financial institutions were helpful, according to the study.Meanwhile, S&L executives interviewed said they felt the regulations of the Community Reinvestment Act should be revised directly with actual cases of lending discrimination rather than to intangibles in the valuation of performance of community service.Copies of the study, funded by a grant from the Missouri Savings & Loan League, are available from the St. Louis University School of Business and Administration, at $5 per copy."
Activists Boo Officials On Lending,The American Banker,"June 19, 1979, Tuesday","Despite jeers and hisses from the audience at the National People's Action annual meeting here, Comptroller of the Currency John G. Helmann and Irvine H. Sprague, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said neither agency was prepared to adopt additional antiredlining regulations.The NPA, a coalition of neighborhood groups which is trying to get financial institutions to make more loans for mortgages in urban areas, demanded that Mr. Heimann and Mr. Sprague push their agencies to adopt regulations specifically prohibiting redlining, the practice of refusing to make mortgage loans in certain neighborhoods despite the credit-worthiness of applicants. The Community Reinvestment Act and other Federal laws are aimed at prohibiting the practice.The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, represented at the NPA meeting by board member Anita Miller, already has additional antiredlining regulations on its books.""If we can't do the job with what we have, we'll get the tools we need,"" Mr. Sprague told the crowd, after he explained that the CRA and the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act were ""good vehicles"" for enforcement which had not yet been fully tested.Earlier, Mr. Sprague was shouted down by people in the audience when he attempted to tell a story about his experiences as a young journalist.""We don't care!"" they yelled. ""Be quiet.""ABA president John H. Perkins was forced to cut short his prepared remarks after hecklers from the crowd shouted they were not interested in what he intended to say.""Answer our questions,"" shouted someone from the crowd.""Am I expected to answer all questions with a 'yes' or 'no'?"" asked Mr. Perkins.The ABA president would not agree to demands that the ABA support the extension of the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, which expires at the end of the month and he refused to arrange for the NPA to make a presentation to the ABA membership at the association's annual conference in October.Hundreds of chanting demonstrators followed Mr. Perkins out the door at the end of the meeting, stamping their feet, clapping, and singing ""When NPA goes marching in,"" to the tune of ""When the Saints Go Marching In.""Gale Cincotta, chairperson of NPA, told Mr. Perkins that ""thousands"" of demonstrators would attend the ABA convention.""You bring in experts, you bring in regulators, you bring in everyone you want -- what's wrong with the people?"" Mrs. Cincotta asked.Mr. Perkins has won praise from NPA in the past because Continental Illinois National Bank & Trust Co., Chicago, of which he is president, last year made a $375,000 grant to fund urban rehabilitation in the city.During the meeting, Mr. Perkins agreed to discuss with the ABA board the possibility of adopting a resolution supporting ""fair lending"" practices, although he insisted banks already were adhering to fair lending standards because they are required by law to do so.""You're not doing it,"" members of the audience shouted in response.The ABA president at first appeared to agree to NPA's request that he sit down with financial institution regulators and discuss how to keep mortgage interest rates down, but he was shouted down when he linked rising interest rates to inflation, and plans for the meeting were abandoned.FHLBB member Miller, Comptroller Heimann and FDIC director Sprague agreed to meet with NPA to discuss the problem of rising mortgage interest rates, but they were unable to reach accord with the group on other points.Mrs. Cincotta interrupted Mr. Heimann once to ask whether ""strong antiredlining regs"" would have made him vote differently on the Greater New York Savings Bank case. Mr. Heimann decided in that case that despite a questionable lending record to low-and moderate-income neighborhoods, the bank should be allowed to branch.Mrs. Cincotta later congratulated Mr. Sprague for his ""no"" vote on the GNYSB application, calling it ""a vote which shook the industry."" The last member of the three-man FDIC board, William M. Isaac, also voted against the application. It was rejected by the 2-1 vote.The NPA meeting Sunday, which drew 2,000 participants, featured a rock and roll band from a local high school, banners, placards, and helium balloons.A trumpet player blew ""Bronx cheer"" sounds, and let air out of balloons, when the regulators' answers did not conform to NPA's demands.All three regulators were applauded when they agreed to support extension of the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, but none of them would agree to stop granting conditional approvals to financial institutions' in instances when applications to branch or merge are challenged by community groups under the CRA.NPA maintains that regulators should turn down applications from banks which community groups allege have poor lending records to low-income areas.Said one NPA member, Herb Steiner of Brooklyn, ""If you say 'maybe' all the time, you'll take the strength out of CRA. Once you take away banks' fear of the 'no', they're not going to want to talk to us.""Mrs. Miller, Mr. Heimann and Mr. Sprague argued that conditional approvals were a valuable tool that encouraged direct negotiations between financial institutions, regulators and community groups.The regulator agreed that public hearings in cases where community groups challenge applications to branch or merge on the basis of the financial institution's lending record should be held in the city where both lender and community group are based. The three also agreed to consider holding the hearings so that those who must work during the day can participate."
442 S&Ls Get $1.26 Bil. in CIF Advances in First 8 Months,The American Banker,"February 23, 1979, Friday","FHLBB chairman Robert H. McKinney said at a press conference this was on schedule with the agency's projections for the first phase of the program.He said that participating S&Ls range in size from $5 million to $10 billion in assets.The CIF carries a total funding of $10 billion to be advanced to the industry during a five-year period.It is intended to provide funds to S&Ls for new and established community lending programs at rates 0.5% below the estimated cost of funds to the Federal Home Loan Bank System.Mr. McKinney said the estimated cost to the system of providing the low interest advances is approximately $250 million, but added that it is an investment well made.The FHLBB said the advances thus far have ranged from $150,000 to $30 million.Jack Watson, assistant to President Carter for intergovernmental affairs, praised the FHLBB Thursday for having ""moved a tremendous amount of money in a very short time.""The CIF provides S&Ls with the flexibility to devise their own programs for the use of the advances, but the FHLBB requires that the district banks monitor the application of the funds at least annually to evaluate whether the funds are being used properly.The 422 participating S&Ls after the first eight months of the program comprise 13.6% of the industry, the FHLBB said.The agency said 156 of them have asseus of more than $250 million; 103 are from the asset range of $100 million-$250 million; 68 are in the $50 million-$99 million range, and the remaining 95 S&Ls have $50 million or less in assets.The FHLBB said the S&Ls are using the CIF advances for 293 inner-city investment programs, 119 rural programs and 35 suburban programs.The major programs benefiting from the CIF advances, according to data from the FHLBB, are counseling programs, Neighborhood Reinvestment Corp. programs, Community Development Block Grants administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and Federal Housing Administration insurance programs."
"S&L, Mutual Join Science Hall Club",The American Banker,"February 26, 1979, Monday","""Every great institution must have the support of the community which it serves"", said Wallace M. West, executive director of the Hall of Science in welcoming the new charter members.Through the corporate membership club, the Hall of Science hopes to interest local business corporations to support New York City's only science and technology center so that it can build an institution in New York as vital as the Ontario Science Museum in Toronto, the Franklin Institute of Science in Philadelphia and the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago.""At a time when international corporations like Exxon and IBM realize the importance of spending millions of dollars to support the arts and sciences on a nationwide scale, it is hoped that the local business community will support cultural institutions in New York with their tax deductible corporate membership dollars. Their help is essential for New York to remain the cultural, financial and tourist capital of the nation."

Dangerous Game of Follow the Leader,The American Banker,"January 24, 1979, Wednesday","Many bankers believe they have been led down the wrong path time and again by following major city banks. They have learned too late to their sorrow that often what works for a city institution may be the proper approach for a bank in a smaller town.An example is the way large banks took to liability management as it developed about a decade ago.They put to use their ability to buy money through certificates of deposit, the purchase of Federal funds, and the use of the Eurodollar market. They recognized that so long as they were willing to pay the going rate, this would largely immunize them from the restraints on availability of funds that the Federal Reserve imposed in inflationary business cycle periods.The smaller and medium-size banks that imitated the giants in liability management found, however, that too often this was a game they could not play well. They found that when credit go tight, investors with cash became more selective as to where they would place it. The medium-sized banks were the first to be eliminated from the list.Frequently, however, these banks found they could not get money they needed at any price, even if they were willing to pay a differential over the rates money market center banks said. For rates in general became so high that the corporate treasurer found he could get all the yield he wanted without taking the risk of going into lesser names whose certificates lacked liquidity in the secondary market if the treasurer needed to sell them.Similarly, the community banks have found that at times they are better served by not following the lending policies of the majors. Major banks may develop programs involving complicated credits with caps on interest rates and features that Fortune 500 firms might find attractive. But the other banks have found that this was unnecessary and unappreciated at home.In fact, some banks have found that they need not even follow the leadership of the majors in rate determination. Because the borrowing customers of these banks want loyalty above rate, and they are willing to pay a little extra over a publicized prime to know they are dealing with a local bank that will stick with them no matter the conditions in the marketplace.Here again the game of follow the leader was unneeded and in some cases harmful to a long-standing relationship.We see now, with regard to electronic funds transfer services, the same type of differentiation. For many smaller and medium-sized banks have found that the giants took steps in EFTs that solved problems that they faced in their communities but that were not truly needed in the territories in which these smaller banks operated.Major city institutions, for example, feel that check-guarantee programs and automatic verification machinery may be necessary in their cities because the check has ceased to be a negotiable instrument in those towns without such hardware verification.This is certainly not true in much of the rest of America, and this makes the high expense of such systems less necessary.Similarly, the expenditure for automated tellers to provide 24-hour banking may be necessary in some cities. But in other communities, where people have more traditional hours and there is little use for cash in the evening, again such expenditure may be unnecessary.The problem is, however, that the major institutions have always been the leaders in publicity and in advocating and promoting the newer trends in banking. And it takes a strong will to go against such a tide.But leaders of community banks sometimes wonder whether these major city institutions are not like the commander who leads the troops to the edge of the cliff and then watches as the others plunge into the abyss.Banking is different from town to town, and what serves one community well may server others badly.At times follow the leader may be a good game for banking. But each banker must understand the underlying premises for the leaders' actions that motivated the step taken before he follows this lead. For if the premises at home differ, the results will be different, even if the actions taken are identical."
PSFS Brochure Outlines Policies,The American Banker,"April 16, 1979, Monday","The brochure includes a general description of PSFS' objectives and disclosure policies, its commitment to corporate responsibility, operating policy guidelines and the functions of the board of trustees. In addition, specific disclosure policies for such services and activities as deposit accounts, mortgage investment, security investment and the personnel function are provided in the brochure.The mutual savings bank recognizes a corporate responsibility which necessarily extends beyond the services it provides its customers. A climate of rising expectations and a multitude of sometimes conflicting demands make it difficult to operate a business in a socially responsive manner simply by the exercise of goodwill. To be effective, a program of corporate responsibility must be as carefully planned, executed and supervised as any other major corporate undertaking. With the leadership and continuing involvement of its board of trustees, PSFS has adopted formal policies as a guide to meeting its responsibilities, initiated a wide variety of action programs, defined clearly the procedures for monitoring the effectiveness of these programs, and organized a Community Affairs Committee to administer them, the bank says in the brochure under the heading on Corporate Responsibility.The Community Affairs Committee consists of eight members representing various officer and employee levels of the bank, including executive management.Under guidelines established by the board of trustee, the committee, with staff support from the community affairs administrator, is responsible for the initiation and administration of programs, the allocation of charitable and other contributions, and the review of effectiveness of both internal and external action programs so that improvements can be made in the future.The brochure was produced as part of the financial institution's on-going efforts to remain accessible to depositors and general public who wish to know more about the bank's operations and policies.Copies of the new booklet may be obtained by writing to PSFS, Public Relations Department, 1212 Market Street, Philadelphia, Pa. 19107 or by calling PSFS."

Conn. Thrifts Will Not Appeal Court Edict Allowing CU to Expand Its Membership,The American Banker,"December 19, 1979, Wednesday","Last month, a Superior Court judge upheld a 1977 decision to allow the expansion by State Banking Commissioner Lawrence Connell Jr., who has since left the post to become the Federal credit union regulator as head of the National Credit Union Administration.A group of 10 mutual savings banks, savings and loan associations and credit unions in Groton, New London and Norwich brought the suit. They charged that the commissioner's action created an unfair competitive advantage and that such a change should have been made by legislation rather than through an administrative decision.Prior to the 1977 action, the credit union's membership was limited to personnel at the United State Navy submarine base here, their families and area military veterans. The CU currently has 28,000 members and assets of $47.1 million.With the legal issue apparently settled, the CU will now be able to solicit business from many residents or workers in Groton, New London, Norwich and several other local communities, as well as Federal employees throughout Connecticut who are not serviced by another credit union.Community Service CU has been allowed to expand its membership since the original commissioner's order, but has not been able to mention the change in its promotional efforts because of the lawsuit.Shortly after the appeal was begun by the thrifts, State Banking Commissioner David H. Neiditz issued an order prohibiting the CU from soliciting new members from its expanded membership field until the issue was settled."
ABA Seeks Broader Dialogue,The American Banker,"February 26, 1979, Monday","Community bankers will be able to call on the ABA spokespersons to come to their areas and address their annual meetings, high school student groups, chambers of commerce or other situations in which community bankers might want such assistance.The program is an outgrowth of an analysis by an ABA public relations task force of a four-year-old program in which women bankers, designated consumer advisers, were made available nationwide to discuss financial and banking matters of interest to women.The ABA communications council and the ad hoc task force which came up with the spokesperson program decided that ""women don't need to be talked down to any more. It shouldn't be how can a woman get a loan and how can a man get a loan; it should be how can a person get a loan."" Consequently, a consumer advisers program for women has been intergrated into the new program, which will use both men and women bankers.Besides providing community bankers with spokespersons, the program will also place spokespersons on national radio and television talk shows and make them available for newspaper interviews and magazine features, primarily in the 100 largest markets.Carl Byoir and Associates, a New York public relations firm, has been chosen out of six agencies applying to the communications council to administer the program for a 16-month period. The ABA spokesman emphasized that ability to understand the importance of the community banker aspect of the project was very important in choosing the agency to administer it.""The bankers felt that they needed more being said about bankers and banking out front before the public,"" the spokesman explained. The ABA also wants to have more ""bankers who have the credentials and the proper title and the ability to communicate about financial matters and issues affecting bankers and their customer"" available on a face-to-face basis to answer questions that will assist people in their financial planning, the spokesman said.""We will be talking to bank customers about issues which affect them, giving advice to help them in financial planning and explaining why a commercial banker can help better than anyone else,"" the spokesman said.The program divides the country into six regions, each of which will have a team of spokespersons identified with it. The spokespersons will be trained in a special media school teaching them how to best communicate in the print, radio and television media. Testing in various areas in each region will begin this summer and the spokesman said that if the program can be readied in time, it will be started in September.Spokespersons will not represent the industry in their own regions, the spokesman added.The chairman of the ABA communications council is Sandra McLaughlin, vice president of Mellon Bank NA, Pittsburgh, and the vice chairman is Richard Rosenberg, executive vice president of Wells Fargo Bank NA, San Francisco. It is made up of 27 bankers and its mission it is to analyze banking issues and programs of the ABA and decide the best method of communicating these to the public.The bankers who participated in the public relations task force were its chairman, Norman Ross, vice president-public affairs, First National Bank of Chicago; Ann Bennett, vice president-advertising, Bank of California NA, San Francisco; William W. Philip, president, Puget sound National Bank, Tacoma; Jen C. Mooney, vice president, First Alabama Bank of Montgomery NA, and William W. Travis, vice president-marketing, First National Bank of Toledo, Ohio."
Effective Positioning Provides an Edge Over Competition,The American Banker,"September 24, 1979, Monday","In the commercial banking industry, perhaps, we have allowed ourselves to be ""out-positioned"" recently, and it is time we did something about it.In the decade of ""scrambled finance,"" the commercial banking industry has lost its share of business to newly emerged competitive forces inside and outside of the financial service arena. The province of the commercial banker has been invaded by the armies of money market funds, cash reserve funds, and commercial paper. These armies have chipped away at the former bastions of commercial banking: checking accounts, diversified savings accounts, and investment and loan products.Under siege, the commercial banking industry, for the most part, has retreated. Unfortunately, many commercial banks have conceded the ground, turning away from the communities in which they are based to more exotic sources of income. Witness the dispatching of national and international lending officers to the four corners of the earth by banks located outside of the recognized money centers.However, I am proud to say that our bank has stood its ground. In both our internal and external communications efforts, we have chosen to emphasize our commitment to our marketplace. We have emphasized the unparalled advantages that commercial banks have over these newly emerged competitive forces. We have dared to ask the question: ""Where would our communities be without us?"" We have dared to ask which of these competitive instruments can offer the essential reinvestment of funds into the community, the social and cultural commitment, the local risk-taking --stability of our communities.In defending our ""position,"" we have clung to a niche between that of a ""country"" bank and a ""regional"" bank. We endeavor to serve young families in our rural boroughs as we serve large corporate customers in growing cities along the fringes of the Northeastern megalopolis. Maintaining that niche presents a dilemma which we have christened ""the two billion dollar question"": ""How does a bank keep the 'personal touch' while approaching its second billion dollars in assets?""The answer to the ""two billion dollar question"" has many parts, best summed up in the single term ""responsiveness.""Being responsive to community needs is synonymous with knowing what your capabilities are. In banking, as in many other businesses, a company often prospers by not doing things that its competitors may be doing. At our own bank it may place our condition in better perspective to concede what we are not doing, as well as what we are doing to preserve the soundness and liquidity of our company. We are not engaged in foreign borrowing and lending. We are not engaged in foreign exchange trading. We are not engaged in bond trading, and we have no borrowing relationships with real estate investment trusts.We are carrying on the business of operating a sound commercial bank, dedicated to serving the areas in which our branch offices are located. Decades before the passage of the Community Reinvestment Act, our bank's management saw the role of a commercial bank as being dedicated to serving its local communities. When banks don't support their communities, those communities have problems. When the communities have problems, the banks have problems.In our estimation, the primary objective of a commercial bank should be to serve its trading area by financing the total needs of its communities. Service should be rendered to large and small businesses. Industry, municipalities and families toward the betterment of job opportunities and living conditions for the people living in those communities. In the case of our own bank, the need to be large enough, capable enough and responsive enough to keep pace with our progressive trading area continues to provide the impetus for growth and expansion.Although our bank is centered in the heart of ""horse 'n buggy"" country, its trading area encompasses seven clearly distinct counties of Southeastern Pennsylvania. It is an area of approximately 4,600 square miles -- larger than the combined size of Delaware and Rhode Island and nearly as large as Connecticut. Our network of community banking offices spans approximately 100 road miles from the area's northern tip to the southwest tip and nearly as far to the southeast tip.Having served this area for nearly a century, we have come to realize that each of our communities has its own distinctive characteristics. Each has its own character in terms of people, businesses and economic climates. The deposit base and customer mix differs from region to region. This is precisely where a bank such as ours faces its biggest challenge: our officers and employees must respond to these varying needs as small town bankers, backed by the resources of a big, if not ""big city,"" bank.More than ever before, a customer expects to deal with a banker who has decision-making authority. The customer expects a ""yes"" or ""no"" decision from the ""banker on the spot"" -- and not from some impersonal committee, from the president of the bank, or from some other third party at a distant headquarters location. For this reason, we committed ourselves to maintaining as much of the decision-making authority as possible at the point closest to the customer. This concerted policy of ""regionalization,"" or regional autonomy, has met with much success. Our regional officers and local branch managers represent our bank to their local communities.They are capable of anticipating problems and opportunities in their own unique markets; they live and work there and, therefore, have a good feel for the local business and social climates.To show the responsiveness of our ""country/regional"" bank in action, I would like to use examples drawn from crisis or near-crisis conditions occuring within our trading area in this decade. Our bank's community responsiveness during these episodes, each of which drew national and international attention, would do justice to any CRA file.Most people will remember tropical storm Agnes only as a torrential rain that caused widespread flood damage in Southeastern Pennsylvania during the summer of 1972. However, months and even years later, our bank's lending officers were still processing applications for loans totalling in the millions to individuals and businesses. Many loans were short-term, assisting the borrowers until the Small Business Administration was able to make a commitment for a longer term.Anticipating the heavy demand for loans to repair flood damage, our lending staffs set up special flood loan centers before individuals and businesses even had the opportunity to assess their losses. When the SBA arrived on the scene several days after the floods, one of their first contacts was with our employees, who loaned the SBA staff surplus office equipment with which to furnish their own makeshift offices.On a more personal note, many of our branch offices in the flood-ravaged area organized voluntary flood relief drives, contributing truckloads of groceries, medical supplies, household necessities, and ready cash for victims to purchase additional food and supplies. The bank's messenger trucks also delivered relief supplies.A similar relief effort marked our bank's response to the Tower City coal mine tragedy in March of 1977. Our employees in the midst of Pennsylvania'a anthracite region counted the miners among their friends, neighbors and relatives. One of our branch offices, just six miles from the mine entrance, was the depository for a relief fund to aid the miners and their families.Contributions came in to the Tower City relief fund from all over the country. More than $6,000 arrived in one day's mail alone. Our branch employees designed an assembly line operation to tally and process the donations. In all, the fund exceeded $60,000, including a contribution from American Bank.In the spring of 1975, after a mere two days of planning, our bank stepped into the world of Vietnamese and Cambodian refugees at the U.S. Army's Fort Indiantown Gap. Within 24 hours of the oral approvals from Federal and state authorities, our bank was ready to serve the first of 15,000 refugees. News media across the nation and the world reported the story of the ""instant bank"" serving the refugees.Finally, although our banks's closest office to the generating station at Three Mile Island is some 25 miles distant, our personnel responded to the recent nuclear incident there. They came through on short notice with ready funds for power company officials as well as a competitive bank whose offices experienced heavy cash withdrawals by evacuating customers in the days following the incident. The cooperation displayed by normally competitive banks during the nuclear incident's aftermath was most encouraging. It clearly shows the kind of community service that commercial banks can best bring to their communities. It is the kind of service which commercial bankers must continue to provide. More importantly, it is the kind of service we must begin to talk about."

ABA Launches SBA Workshops,The American Banker,"March 19, 1979, Monday","Five SBA guaranteed lending workshops are planned by the ABA's commercial lending division, sponsor of the program: April 3, Chicago; April 5, New York City; May 8, Dallas; May 10, Atlanta; and May 22, Salt Lake City.Richard F. Ford, ABA division chairman and president of First National Bank, St. Louis, noted that several important factors have given rise to these workshops.""Inflationary interest rates and a general lack of loanable funds among many banks have in some cases made it more difficult for small business to obtain normal bank credit,"" Mr. Ford said. ""However, the growing secondary market for SBA guaranteed loans enables banks to profitably meet small business credit needs without adversely affecting loan to deposit ratios.""Major improvements in the SBA's programs have speeded processing time, eased the administrative requirements and improved the yield on SBA guaranteed loans,"" he added. ""SBA guaranteed loans also offer banks an effective means to ensure full compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act.""Each program is designed to ensure that regional credit considerations are addressed. Some speakers and panel participants for each workshop are being drawn from the local area, the ABA spokesman noted."
Agency Usurping Of Congress Seen,The American Banker,"April 5, 1979, Thursday","Richard M. Kovacevich, senior vice president of the New York bank, who was speaking at a Conference Board conference on corporate responsibility issues, asked whether laws are being written by Congress or by nonelected officials of Federal agencies.Speaking at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, Mr. Kovacevich said another fundamental CRA issue is whether credit allocation is a ""hidden agenda."" CRA, he said, ""may become the foundation for a government-mandated system of credit allocation, where banks are told which loans to make, where and to whom.""The Citibank official questioned whether there are less expensive ways of influencing corporate behaviour and noted that Citibank's cost to comply with CRA will approach $100,000, which is in addition to $2.6 million he said the bank is spending annually to meet bank regulatory reporting requirements.Mr. Kovacevich observed that ""if CRA caused Citibank to do anything differently, it resulted in giving even greater responsibility for community affairs to our local business managers, our line managers, rather than to a community relations expert.""He recommended that banks think of disclosure requirements such as CRA as communications vehicles for implementing broader corporate strategies.He also recommended seeking out fundamental concerns in establishing parameters for what should be stressed in disclosure requirements. Thus, in complying with CRA, he said the bank decided the fundamental question was not where its communities are located but whether it considers creditworthy loan applications from anyone living in its marketplace.Another speaker, C. F. Muckenfuss 3d, senior deputy comptroller of the currency, told the corporation officials present that if CRA has a good result, it will be that banks use their problem-solving ability to figure out how, in a profitable way, they can help solve problems in their communities.Responding to questions of concern about how regulators would implement CRA, Mr. Muckenfuss emphasized that the regulators are attempting to be objective. He acknowledged that CRA requirements for a small bank ""must be overwhelming.""In the opening address, William M. Ellinghaus, president of American Telephone & Telegraph Co., said that corporate spokesmanship is among the most important functions of management. But, he said, corporate leaders too often speak privately rather than publicly. They should talk more to the public and to organizations and people that shape public opinion, such as the media, he said.Illustrating his point that business maintains too low a profile, he said a Roper survey found that Frank Fitzsimmons, president of the Teamsters, was known to a third of the people surveyed -- but that retired AT&T chairman John DeButts had a recognition factor of only 3%.He advised executives that ""even when the truth is not especially flattering, it is better to reveal it than to suffer the prolonged agony and ultimately more damaging effects of deception.""Noting the public may be particularly receptive to corporate spokesmanship at this time, Mr. Ellinghaus recommended these principles: anacute sensitivity to concerns of other people; discernment of what will and will not work, of what is right from what is wrong; the courage to be candid; and the persuasiveness which comes from conviction."
CofC Issues Guidebook On Govt. Loan Programs For Small Businesses,The American Banker,"September 14, 1979, Friday","Michael Barton of the Comptroller's community development division, said the agency is in the final stages of revising and editing the publication. It describes government programs, loan guarantees and interest subsidies available to banks for loans to small firms, housing projects and small business investment companies.The guidebook does not signal any changes in eligibility for small business loans offered by banks, according to Mr. Barton. Existing loan programs such as Economic Development Administration programs for large-scale industrial development and government agency programs such as Housing and Urban Development, Federal Housing Administration, Small Business Administration and Federal National Mortgage Association projects are the focus of the book, he said.In addition, the book includes two recently funded loan programs, the Livable Cities Program and the Neighborhood Self Help Program, Mr. Barton said.The book classifies loan programs according to the income needs of small businesses, he added.The guidebook does not set requirements for national banks, Mr. Barton stressed. ""It is not intended that Community Reinvestment Act performance had kept his promise to fill in the open spaces.""Mr. Crisp contended in a suit against the bank that the bank should have been alert to the fact that the check was large and that Mr. Carter was a stranger with no account and no community connections.A Daviess Circuit Court jury returned a verdict against the Owensboro National bank for the amount of the altered check, and the bank appealed.The bank contended that Mr. Crisp was contributorily negligent and that it paid the check in good faith and in accordance with reasonable commercial standards.But the appeals court noted, among other things, that the jury took into account that the Kentucky driver's license used as identification by Mr. Carter contained his place of employment, which valid state licenses do not; that it contained a black and white picture, which state licenses do not; that Mr. Carter was not asked if he had an account at the bank, and that no other identification was sought.The policy underlying the imposter rule is to place the loss on the party that should presumably have the best opportunity to check the identity of the imposter. ""We believe Crisp has carried his burden,"" the panel said.The man calling himself Mr. Carter has since been apprehended and found guilty and is serving a prison sentence for duping Mr. Crisp."
Calif. Bank Offers Merchant Referrals,The American Banker,"January 30, 1979, Tuesday","""When one of our customers is looking for a particular type of service, we check our commercial files to see if any of our clients offer the kind of service needed,"" Jerrold T. Henley, Cache Creek president, said.He emphasized that ""this type of hometown service promotes business in the community while also enhancing the local service image of the bank, an image, he noted, that is ""critical to the livelihood"" of this two-year old institution.Cache Creek, with $18 million in deposits, and $19 million in assets, experienced 117% growth during the first year of operation, Mr. Henley said. The bank was opened in January, 1976.Another part of Cache Creek's personal approach is Mr. Henley's ""Cache Creek Connection,"" which puts local businessmen in contact with one of nine bank directors attuned to that businessman's particular financial needs.""The directors of the bank are very active in the community, letting businessmen know that there is a local bank that can provide innovative financing,"" Mr. Henley said. Cache Creek at this time does not specialize its interests, he said, and lends in about equal proportions in the consumer, mortgage and commercial areas."
Bill Allowing Detached Facility Loans Gains in ND; Spurs Branching Debate,The American Banker,"February 22, 1979, Thursday","The proposal, endorsed independently of any organization by about 69 banks throughout the state, goes to the House floor for debate on Thursday.North Dakota banks can operate one limited service facility within the city limits of its main officer or within three miles of corporate limits in communities where there is not bank. Additionally, banks can establish paying and receiving stations in bankless towns within 35 miles of the main office.The effort to pass the proposal is being led by Henry N. Ness, senior vice president of the $91.5 million deposit Fargo National Bank who said banks seeking loan making authority at detached facilities have no interest in statewide branching but do believe that the many communities without banks should have better banking services.Mr. Ness, immediate past president of the North Dakota Bankers Association and officer at a bank which is a member of the Independent Community Banks of North Dakota, said the main opposition to the bill is coming from members of the executive council of the 125-member independent groups who maintain that permitting loans at the facilities would lead to more extensive branching provisions the next time the legislature meets in 1981.Moreover, Mr. Ness said, the community banking group has testified in hearings that if the bill is enacted, the Comptroller will rule that national banks can branch statewide, citing as evidence the Comptroller's 1978 ruling in Oklahoma which, declared national banks there could branch because state-chartered trust companies were permitted similar authority.Although lawyers content that the ""making loans"" provision could not possibly be construed as permitting statewide branching, legislators are listening to the argument and the vote is expected to be extremely close, Mr. Ness said.The North Dakota BA is neutral on the issue as was its position on a statewide branching bill which was defeated in the Senate last week with a 34-16 vote.The key legislation on the BA's agenda this session are two proposals to increase interest rate ceilings, Harry Argue, NDBA's executive director, said.The Senate on Friday passed a bill that increases the state's floating rate usury ceiling on all personal loans and business loans under $25,000 from 3% to 5 1/2 % over the 30-month Certificate of Deposit rate. The current CD rate is 6.5% so if the law were enacted today, the effective usury rate would be 12%, up from the present 9.5%, Mr. Argue said.The usury proposals, along with a second that raises the maximum rate on instalment bank loans from 1% simple interest per month to 1 1/4 % will now be sent to the House where they are expected to be considered within about two weeks.Mr. Argue was not certain what reception the proposals would receive in the House but he noted the Senate comprehensively ""understood that interest rates were a real problem that could effect the availability of funds in the state."""
Fed Votes BHC Bid Despite CRA Protests,The American Banker,"December 10, 1979, Monday","In a 6-to-1 vote, the Board approved an application from Michigan National Corp., Bloomfield Hills, to acquire almost all the voting shares of four proposed new banks and the Litchfield State Savings Bank, Litchfield.The Board said in its approval order that it had found several of the activists' charges valid, but that the holding com pany had made general commitments to improve its community lending effort as a condition to approval.In a dissent, Emmett J. Rice said that the BHC ""has persistently failed to comply with certain basic requirements of CRA regulations and I would therefore deny these applications.""Applicant has been advised on more than one occasion since the effective date of those regulations that it was not complying with the regulations and also was not in compliance with the similar requirements of the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, which has been in effect since 1975,"" he continued. ""The failure of Applicant's management to take prompt steps to remedy this noncompliance strongly suggests that Applicant does not take these responsibilities seriously.""The Michigan Committee on Law and Housing protested the application on charges that the BHC or its subsidiaries had:failed to comply with technical requirements of the CRA and the HMDA, such as the posting CRA notices in banking offices. The group said it experienced ""considerable difficulty"" in obtaining the CRA statements and HMDA data that banks are required to provide under those laws;drawn the local lending area of one of its Detroit banks to exclude nearby low-local lending area is required by law to appear in a bank's CRA statement;engaged in racial discrimination in the Detroit area by extending more housing-related loans in all-white neighborhoods than in racially mixed neighborhoods with similar income levels.failed to met the housing-related credit needs of the low- and moderate-income neighborhoods of the Detroit area.The group requested that as a condition of approval, the Fed should have required the BHC -- the second largest banking organization in the state -- to make specific commitments on levels of housing-related lending. The Board rejected that request.""It appears that several of Applicant's banking subsidiaries have failed to comply with the procedural requirements of CRA and HMDA,"" the Board order said. ""These requirements are designed to acquaint the community with each bank's lending policies and to permit members of the community to comment on those policies. The Board views this noncompliance as a serious matter, and expects Applicant to take steps to insure full and continuing compliance with these requirements before consummation of these proposals.""The Board said, however, that the CRA lending area of the subsidiary that the group said had been drawn to exclude minority neighborhoods ""appears reasonable when viewed in the context of that bank's total lending pattern as opposed to its distribution of housingrelated loans only.""The Fed also said that it concluded that no racial discrimination had occurred because of the disparity in lending between largely white and largely black areas.The Board ruled that BHC had taken efforts to meet the credit needs of lowand moderate-income neighborhoods. It cited as favorable evidence the BHC's participation in the Small Business Administration lending program and other such programs, and that one of its subsidiaries holding more than $4 million in notes and bonds issued by the Michigan State Housing Development Authority.Despite these efforts, the Board found that the BHC extends ""far less housing-related credit in low- and moderate-income areas than in the rest of the Detroit area.""The Board said that the disparity between the amounts of funds the BHC lent to housing-related credit in these neighborhoods and and loans to other areas ""may be partially the result of factors that affect the demand for such credit. For instance, the percentage of housing units that are owner occupied in these lowand moderate-income areas is approximately one half the percentage of other areas, and Applicant's pattern of lending appears to reflect the pattern of applications it receives.""Nevertheless, Applicant's failure to determine systematically the credit needs of the Detroit area and the fact that its advertising has been deposit rather than credit oriented also may have contributed to this disparity,"" the Board concluded.The approval appeared to involve another effort by the Fed to seek a negotiated settlement between banks and community groups in disagreements arising from the CRA.The BHC and the group met three times at the suggestion of the agency's staff to discuss the issues involved, the order said.The third meeting was conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and resulted in the commitments the BHC made.At present, three applications still pending at the Fed to start or expand BHCs have been chalenged under the CRA."

The acquisition is subject to approval by regulatory authorities.First Bancshares' remaining three banking and three nonbanking subsidiaries will continue to be controlled by the holding company, which will change its name to Gulfstream Banks, Inc.Under terms of the arrangement, one share of Gulfstream common stock and approximately one-tenth share of Southeast preferred stock will be exchanged for each outstanding share of First Bancshares common.The Southeast preferred provides for annual cumulative dividends at the rate of $4.06 per share and a liquidation preference of $55 per share. It may be redeemed after five years, at the option of Southeast, for $55, and it is immediately convertible at the option of the shareholder into 3.75 shares of Southeast common.Southeast is Florida's largest banking organization, with total assets of $4.4 billion and 60 banking offices throughout the state."
Court Returns S&L Applications to FHLBB,The American Banker,"June 28, 1979, Thursday","The three-judge panel has returned the two branch applications to the FHLBB for a clarification of its decision.In a critical lashing at bureaucratic jargon, the judicial panel in its final conclusion said the ""courts should not routinely accept agency explanations paraphrased broadly in terms of the governing statute, ""a formal abracadabra to which it has added a few words as a sop to us.""In so ruling, the Court of Appeals has overturned two separate rulings from the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin which upheld the decision of the FHLBB in approving a branch and limited facility branch application by Wisconsin's largest institution, the $818 million-deposit First Savings Association of Wisconsin, Milwaukee. Adding to the complexities of the decision is the Milwaukee thrift's recent conversion to a state-chartered institution.Harvey Simon, assistant general counsel in the litigation division of the FHLBB said he was surprised with the decision. ""It represents a departure from all other case law.""We are concerned about the implications that our standard resolutions or explanations of criteria we use for the establishment of a branch are not adequate for judicial review and we are considering what options to take,"" said Mr. Simon.The legal counsel emphasized that he was speaking only of his own initial reaction, not for the Board. Explaining that his division had just received the five-day old, 22-page decision, Mr. Simon said it would be at least a week before the Board has an official position on the decision.""Up till now, the courts -- including the sixth and eight circuit courts -- have uniformly ruled that our resolutions were adequate for them to review,"" Mr. Simon said. Technically, the decision applies only to states in the Seventh Circuit -- Wisconsin, Indiana and Illinois -- so ""it is unclear how it (the decision) would affect our procedures as a result.""But lawyers representing the two thrifts which challenged the FHLBB in its approval of the branch applications say the decision has several broad ramifications.Basically at issue in the two legal actions brought by the $85 million deposit City Federal Savings & Loan Association and the $558.6 million deposit Mutual Savings & Loan Association of Wisconsin, both of Milwaukee, were internal documents utilized by the FHLBB to arrive at its branch applications decision and ""community need and undue injury to existing institutions,"" provisions used as criteria for approval of limited service facilities. The two cases were joined in the appellate action.For the first time, in the District Court decision, it was ruled the FHLBB must furnish to the Court all internal staff memorandum -- digest, recommendations, evaluation by supervisory agencies and the Office of Industry and Development,"" Edward A. Dudek, one of the attorneys for the two thrifts said.Up to this ruling, he said, all an agency had to file for judicial review and to institutions challenging a branch application was a summary and recitation of its standard operating language -- ""no undue injury to their institution and meet community need standards."" ""The courts have always deferred to agency expertise,"" Mr. Dudek said.In the Appeals Court decision, the court said that the agency, of course, ""need not undertake the difficult project of defining this concept by regulation, but the Board must at least articulate on a case-by-case basis what it considers relevant to this issue.""Referring to the community needs provision for chartering de novo or approving a branch and in the case of City Federal's protest against a limited service facility, the circuit court said the First Savings argues that reliance on ""its penetration in the primary service equates the institutions' convenience with community needs.""The court said that it doubted it could uphold a determination of community needs on this basis, but added it had no way of knowing this based on the language of the Board's summary decision.In the Mutual case, the FHLBB had rejected First Savings application for a branch at a shopping center on two occasions in 1968 and 1969, stating ""the impact . . . could only be catastrophic in its effect on numerous association located therein . . .""By then approving the Branch in 1972, the Circuit Court said it is unable ""to discern any articulation of factors justifying the drastic change of viewpoint.""Moreover, Mr. Dudek said, the court has made note of a chartering provision in the Home Owner Loan Act of 1933 which states the intent is to ""supplement state-chartered financial institutions, not to replace them.""""We've never had a definition of need,"" Mr. Dudek said. ""Not in 40 years."" In the past, need was a decision made by the Board on an individual basis, without any case-by-case precedent, but this ruling appears to say the Board must take into account whether state-chartered associations are adequately servicing the needs of the public, Mr. Dudek said.In the Circuit Court ruling, written by Judge Wilbur F. Pell Jr., the court said . . . . ""leaving the determination of community necessity . . . to directionless discretionary opinion could mean the determination could well vary with every change of the makeup of the membership of the Board. Even though Congress has not seen fit to prescribe statutory standards applicable to branching, we decline to believe that body entertained the idea that once an incipient association had gotten over the hurdle of chartering, it could spread separate branches throughout its designated banking territory without regard to any of the qualifying prerequisites . . .""""What the decision is talking about is accountability, ""Mr. Dudek said. ""The court has ruled that it does not want to interfere with decision-making of the agency, but if there is to be a decision-making process, the agency will have to respond to people as the issues are raised.""Mr. Simon of the FHLBB said the agency has three options, one of which is to accept the court's decision and attempt to comply with it. The second is to ask for a rehearing and the third, request U.S. Supreme Court review."

San Diego S&L Bid for Branch Protested on Lien Sale Grounds,The American Banker,"May 25, 1979, Friday","Home representatives are scheduled to meet Friday with six Los Angeles protesters, who have filed the first complaint under the Community Reinvestment Act to involve S&L-financed lien sale contracts for home improvements.In a recent protest to Home's application for a new branch in La Jolla, the protesters told the Federal Home Loan Bank Board of San Francisco that literally hundreds of low-income Los Angeles residents are losing or face loss of their homes because of abuses in the lien contract financing system.Lien contracts essentially are time payment contracts for home improvements containing a trust deed on the homeowner's home. The trust deed contains a private power of sale. This means that if the homeowner defaults, the secured contractor may sell the home at a foreclosure auction without the necessity of any prior court hearing, the protest explained.Contractors, it said, assign home improvement contracts to Home, which in turn pays a discounted amount for the contracts. Home sets up a reserve account for each contractor. Any contract in default, the protest said, is reassigned to the contractor, thus relieving Home of the necessity of a foreclosure and any consequent auditing problems.The protest said that the phenomenon of lien contracts, on such home improvements as texture coating and room additions, largely is concentrated on mortgage-deficient low-income black neighborhoods of central and south central Los Angeles.Ray Mercado, associate counsel with Home Federal, said that Home recognizes that from time to time abuses are committed by contractors and, particularly, by salesmen, who he said are difficult to control. Home, he said, has only indirect control and is basically in a third-party situation with these contractors.Mr. Mercado added that statistics were unavailable on the number of home improvement lien sales Home financed during 1978. He said he thought that four contractors -- which the protest singles out as responsible for many consumer complaints and which were once financed by Home -- represented about 1% to 2% of all the contractors with whom Home Federal has had business dealings.Charles F. Elsesser Jr., attorney with the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles, which filed the objection, said the protest raised the issue of quality, and not just quantity, of credit in a neighborhood. He said contractors in question did not complete work contracted for, greatly overcharged for the work, or pressured people to sign contracts without disclosing they could lose their homes.Commercial banks, Mr. Elsesser said, also finance lien contracts in California but similar problems have not arisen with those contractors. He estimated that only a half-dozen California S&Ls finance home improvements of the lien sale type, and that of these Home Federal and San Diego Federal Savings & Loan Association have at least 50% of this business. Mr. Mercado essentially agreed with the 50% assessment.The protest said that Home Federal's only service in the black community is the financing of lien sale contracts for home improvements. The protest added that Home has provided almost no mortgage loans in south-central Los Angeles, according to the S&L's Home Mortgage Disclosure Statements during the past three years.It further alleges that the placement of Home Federal offices, and the community delineation on its CRA statement, effectively have excluded minority low and moderate-income communities in Los Angeles from participation in its services.An official of the U.S. League of Savings and Loan Associations in Chicago said that he thought the practice by S&Ls of financing home improvement lien sales was relatively uncommon nationwide.Mr. Mercado said the protesters had incorrectly lumped Home with all problem lien contracts. He said the S&L does not finance home improvement companies that sell burglar alarms and is in the process of ceasing its financing of all dealers of texcote, a spray-on plaster.The Home counsel, who noted Home planned soon to reply to the protest, said the S&L was open to both criticism and change, and said a lack of communication was the main cause of the misunderstanding.Mr. Mercado said the S&L makes direct home improvement loans, but said he did not know if they are made in central-south L.A. neighborhoods. Home, he said, does not have a branch there and that was one reason why it used indirect lien sales.Such sales are common in those neighborhoods, he said. The sales are covered by extensive disclosure but a problem is that the borrowers are ""unsophisticated,"" he said.Mr. Elsesser said he examined liens against real property in the County Recorder's office and that those Home-financed lines which had been the source of consumer complaints represented ""far more"" than the 1% to 20% cited. He said that each day about 30 homes in central-south Los Angeles were going into foreclosure, many as a result of lien contracts. Many of the affected homeowners are on old-age assistance, welfare or disability payments, he said.A bill introduced in California would prohibit the lien-sale contract in certain home improvement sales transactions, such as texture coating and home siding.Protestes are: The Greater University Parish; Community Education Development and Referral Service; Rev. Edgar R. Edwards; Center for New Corporate Priorities; San Pedro Planning Alliance, and People's Housing and Community Development Corporation."
Women's Bank Exceeds Hopes,The American Banker,"July 31, 1979, Tuesday","B. LaRae Orullian, president of the Women's Bank, said the founders of the bank projected deposits of only $6 million to $6.5 million by the end of the first year of operations. Deposits reached the higher figure in the 12th week. Three days before July 14, the bank's first anniversary, deposits totaled $13.08 million.In only 11 months, Miss Orullian said, the bank had recaptured all of its opening and organizational expenses, approximately $140,000.The numbers in the undivided profits column of the bank's financial statements are penned in black ink.Total assets of the bank at the end of June totaled $13.52 million, up from $9.57 million at the end of 1978 and $11.3 million at the end of the first quarter of 1979.Some of the happenings during that first year of operations were expected. Some were surprises, she said.The bank's founders expected a good market among women, a market in which there was a need for a bank.What the founders did not expect was the amount of support the bank would receive from the business community, she said.The Women's Bank, she said, pictured itself as a consumer bank from its conception.Bank officials found a need for the bank's services and personality among small businesses. Miss Orulllian remarked that small businesses had few ""homes"" in the banking community.""They'll be loyal,"" she predicted,"" and we'll grow as they grow."" Most of the bank's loans are to individuals, she said, but about two-thirds of the dollar volume of those loans is to the business community.That does not mean the bank hasn't been businesslike in making its loans, Miss Orullian said. ""We've tried to be careful, they're grade A loans made with straightfoward credit practices.""Because of the banking practices, she said, the bank has received criticism from women who think the bank isn't doing enough for women because of the philosophy that the request for help has to be a bankable situation, she added.That criticism hasn't stopped the bank's momentum, however. Miss Orullian said the switchboard at the bank still receives 280 to 300 telephone calls a day.""Apparently there's a real need for a bank with our focus,"" she said. The bank has approximately 5,000 savings and checking accounts.The bank's success, she said, is due to a combination of the name, the focus and the board of directors. The bank's directors spent a lot of the time before the bank opened speaking with community groups drumming up advance business and account pledges.The bank's focus, she added, is in an area previously untapped by Denver banks."" It's been a very satisfactory financial market."" Miss Orullian said.The focus has been accentuated by a series of seminars, the sack lunch series on Thursday noons, which have been oversubscribed since they started.The seminars feature basic finances with titles like ""Financial Planning, Your Bank and How to Use It, Consumer's Guide to Homeowners and Life Insurance"" and ""Stocks and Bonds.""The seminars are free for bank customers. They're often taught by bank officers or directors.For the next year of operations, Miss Orullian said, the bank will start selling itself. That starts with personal calls on potential customers by Miss Orullian.""During the past year,"" she said, ""we've let the customers come to us, now we'll start going to them more.""A dividend policy does not play a part in the bank's near-term future, she added.The Women's Bank currently as a one-customer loan limit of $200,000. ""I would like to see that expand through retained earnings for larger loans,"" she said."
New S&L Sought In New Jersey,The American Banker,"August 17, 1979, Friday","This is the second such application to be filed, the first having been for one in Hampton Township in rural Sussex County.The latest application has been made by a group of 35 business and professional men from Rumson and nearby communities. They are represented by E. Robert Levy, East Orange attorney who also represents the Hampton Township group.It is proposed to raise $2 million in capitalization for the Rumson operation, to be known as New Jersey Savings & Loan Association. The funds would be raised by sale at 200,000 shares of stock at $10 per share, 155,000 of which have already been subscribed for by the organizers.The Rumson charter application will constitute a first for the State Banking Department when heard.Instead of a departmental hearer, proceedings will be conducted by an administrative law judge, as provided by new legislation. Recommendation will go to the commissioner, as before.The original application, filed in November, 1977, was for the First Sussex County S&L. Hearings have been completed, opposition having been provided over several days of hearings by the Oritani S&L of Randolph Township and the National Community Bank of Rutherford.However, the departmental hearer, J. Roger Perischilli, recommended that the application be approved. Decision of Mr. Bianchi is now being awaited.Creation of stock-chartered S&Ls is possible under a state law passed in 1975 with the support of the New Jersey Savings League.New Jersey has three stock S&Ls --Raritan Valley of East Brunswick, Tri-County of Camden and First of New Brunswick. Each was a state-chartered mutual S&L which was converted to stock form with approval of both the state and the Federal Home Loan Bank Board."
Recruiting Home-Grown Products May Be Way to Hold Onto Trained Employees,The American Banker,"January 9, 1979, Tuesday","It is not only the cost of salaries paid before the employee becomes useful to the bank that worries the bank, but there is also the high cost of the time of other employees taken away from their own work to help the new trainee learn what has to be done and why it must be done a certain way.All too often a bank employee will look at the job of trying to teach a new employee the bank's approach to a problem and decide that it is far simpler and quicker to do it himself than to take the time necessary to train the new trainee as to the bank's method of operation.Training is a slow process. And on top of this, most top bankers recognize that they must let the trainee take a chance and make errors, even at a high cost to the bank, as part of the training process.For there is nothing that teaches a new employee how to do a job right faster than to do it wrong and see the consequences of his action.Bank training is thus a highly expensive and all consuming task. And when a bank sees that the people it has trained leave for other institutions soon after the first bank has put all the time and effort into their training, this is sad indeed.But it is a problem that banks can solve with a little foresight.
Work them HardIn the first place some acute bankers look at the problem and accept it as being something they can adjust to. They try to get valuable work out of new employees as rapidly as possible, so that if they do leave after they are trained, the bank has at least broken even on them or made a little profit on their effort while they were on board.The bank does not coddle new employees but rather expects a full measure of output -- far more than a normal working day if necessary. And if the new hirees cannot accept this regimen, so be it. The bank is better off without such an employee on board.Others look at the prospect of newly trained employees leaving and take a philosphical approach to the problem. They feel that if they have not done a good enough job of motivating people to the career potentials on the bank and have not given them satisfying enough work and rewareded them adequately so that alternative offers do not look attractive, then they deserve a lose the employees.Another approach that banks have taken to insure that they do not serve as free educational institutions for employees who will then give their best efforts to other institutions once trained is to make sure that the bank does not hire people who are overtrained for the jobs the bank wants them for.In this regard some banks are backing away from wanting too many graduates with a Master of Business Administration degree; for they feel that bright people who have just had an undergraduate education can do almost as good a job and cost far less to hire.In addition they feel that the MBA demands movement up on the corporate ladder at a rate that is often faster than the bank is willing to accept, he thus often becomes dissatisfied with bank work all too soon.The hiring of people who fit into the bank's pattern of employment needs thus helps solve the departure problem.
Recruit at HomeBut most important, many banks have found the surest way to keep new employees happy is to avoid the geographical problem that comes from hiring people who were raised or want to live elsewhere.A great deal of bank employee loss comes from people who have moved into a community to take a job, but who find that while they like the bank work, they or their spouses do not like the community. Thus they stay until they are trained and then move on to a community where they feel their life style will be happier, even if the job available is a little less to their liking than the one available in the bank that trained them.One solution to this problem is to recruit at home. Banks find that when they take people who were raised in the community and know its strengths and weaknesses, the problem of employees resigning to get a better geographical environment becomes far less severe. Thus they recruit people who may have studied elsewhere but who have been raised in town, and they also recruit people who have studied at institutions located near the bank.For they recognize that by sticking to people who know and like the community, the heavy expense of training and losing good people can not be eliminated, but it can be sharply reduced."
Anti-Redliners To Confront ABA,The American Banker,"March 5, 1979, Monday","""We want to be on their agenda,"" Mrs. Cincotta stated in a telephone interview last week.""We want to discuss things like bank compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act, and possibly directives. To us, compliance means more than just statements and a map. We think it means putting money back into the neighborhoods. It's up to the larger banks to lead the way, and to set precedents.We'll be asking these things, whether we're invited or not.""""It depends on what they want to say,"" a spokesman for the ABA said, ""and if it's something we want to put on our program."" He said that traditionally speakers are generally bankers. But, he added, ""it may be that NPA has the perfect thing to say, and they may be just the right people to say it.""The group has demonstrated against redlining in the past, often stringing red ribbons around buildings where bankers and legislators were meeting. The anti-redlining activist acknowledges, however, that she prefers to negotiate with bankers, and hopes that those invited to the conference agree to attend."

NPA to Push for ABA Agenda Spot,The American Banker,"August 8, 1979, Wednesday","In a statement issued here, NPA said it is ""stepping up its fight"" with the ABA for increased lending by banks in city neighborhoods and will present its case at the New Orleans meeting ""whether we're on the agenda or not.""National People's Action, headed by Chicago housewife Gail Cincotta, accused the ABA of fostering a dismal record on neighborhood redevelopment, and said under its new strategy it will call on individual bankers across the country by letter and by telegram to support NPA demands.An ABA said spokesman Tuesday there is no plan to allow NPA a place on the NeW Orleans program.""Our program is already formulated,"" he said, adding that the ABA refusal was relayed to Mrs. Cincotta at the annual convention of the NPA in Washington in June.Mrs. Cincotta charged that the ABA has attempted to kill two key laws which have been instrumental in reducing redlining. These are the Community Reinvestment Act and the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act.""Neighborhoods organizations fought hard"" for the two laws ""and we're not going to see them ousted by banking industry lobbies,"" she declared.The two statutes have played a significant role in fostering reinvestment and ""they are the only tools the community has. Without them banks will continue to redline and more communities will be destroyed.""Mrs Cincotta and other NPA leaders first disclosed their demands to appear at the ABA gathering during the NPA's annual convention.At that time NPA demonstrators marched on ABA's Washington headquarters and booed John H. Perkins, president of the ABA, John G. Heimann, Comptroller of the Currency, and Irvine Sprague, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., during speeches they gave before the NPA."
Anti-Redlining Consequences,The American Banker,"January 26, 1979, Friday","The conclusions of the study, done by two professors at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, are simple:Risks are greater in lending to inner city areas than elsewhere.It costs more to service these loans under government regulations that intensify the cost of record keeping, employee training, and reporting.Yet charging more to cover these costs and risks would be considered discriminatory.All of which seem to lead to the conclusion that lending institutions are better off not setting up offices to serve these areas at all, for by avoiding ""troublesome areas"" lenders cannot be held to account for not lending and servicing where they have no facilities for loan processing and servicing.The result is, as Professors Jack Guttentag and Susan Wachter of Wharton show, that Community Reinvestment Act statutes and anti-redlining provisions result frequently in less service to the inner city rather than more. For financial institutions that are there try to leave and those that are not there have no desire to enter. And because of the difficulties in lending, financial institutions try to avoid them completely, which in turn makes it difficult for people in these inner-city areas to get deposit services either.It becomes, then, a reverse twist in which instead of helping the people gain better financial service, the programs frequently lead to worse.Perhaps it is too much to expect that government regulators would see the logic of this. But in many instances officials make the analogy between a bank franchise and that of a television or radio station. And here is where the trouble develops. For the rights and privileges of chartered banks and chartered users of the airwaves differ substantially.All holders of radio and TV licenses recognize that if they do not furnish adequate local public service, they are subject to the loss of the franchise that makes their entire operation possible. And as license renewal time comes up, each new applicant anxious to uproot the present franchise holder promises that it will provide more public service as a justification for changing the license.Banking does not work this way. First, there is no physical limit to the number of bank offices in an area the way there is a limit to TV channels and radio locations. If the community can support more banks and thrifts, the regulators usually are anxious to allow the added competition because of the benefits to the public.Equally significant is the geographic difference. For a TV or radio station serves the whole trading area and more, while a bank serves basically the small location where each office is located.Thus, a bank's requirements for public service when it is chartered are more narrowly focused than those of a TV or radio station. If a bank is not located in a declining area of its community, it has no obligation to serve it, while a media outlet has the obligation to serve a wider evanescent community called its listening area.We have seen banks take the difficult step of closing offices and giving up their franchise to serve certain declining areas of their towns. This has usually involved difficult publicity and hard work. But to avoid entering an area that could use a bank is far easier. The bank merely does nothing.And the Wharton study shows that anti-redlining programs of today's narrow scope reinforce the decision of those banks and thrifts that are doing nothing in this regard.The answer must be positive benefits to banks and thrifts that serve inner-city areas, such as lower reserve requirements or tax benefits, not penalties imposed on those that happen to be there. For penalizing the inner-city bank office because it recognizes the risks of lending close to its home backfires.All it does is reinforce the feeling that what is not an immediate problem should be kept out of mind. And rebuilding or maintaining the quality of life in cities or declining rural communities is too expensive yet broad and important a job to be borne only by those financial institutions that happen to be in these areas because of history or earlier social commitment."
"South Shore NB in Chicago Quits Fed, Cites T&L Costs",The American Banker,"January 4, 1979, Thursday","In leaving the Fed, Ronald Grzywinski, the bank's chairman of the executive committee, explained that South Shore had tried unsuccessfully to get the Treasury Department to grant the south side Chicago bank certain exeptions on TT&L charges afforded to minority banks.However, Treasury ruled that South shore was not a minority-owned bank even though its market was in a predominantly black area of the city and that the institution carried an abnormally high amount of low balance checking accounts, Mr. Grzywinski said.Earnings from TT&L accounts had been used to offset these costs, he continued, but with banks having to start paying interest on them, South Shore decided that it could not withstand these increases and remain members of the Fed.By resigning from the Fed South Shore expects to add an additional $10,000 a month to earnings by being able to invest formerly idle reserves, Mr. Grzywinski explained.The South Shore executive said he pressed his case on the minority exemption with both Undersecretary of the Treasury Bette Anderson and with Illinois U.S. Sen. Adlai Stevenson 3rd but the bank was turned down by both parties. Mrs. Anderson expressed her sympathy to South Shore but said ""there was nothing she could do,"" South Shore has long used TT&L accounts solicitation from corporations as a way of funding its neighborhood development programs in the South Shore area, Mr. Grzywinski said.It was little more than a year ago that South Shore received permission from the Fed in Washington to organize under its parent holding company two community development subsidiaries to engage in rehabilitation and social welfare projects.In its approval of the subsidiaries, City Lands Corp. and the Neighborhood Institute, the Fed said it hoped its action would encourage other private investment in the South Shore area.The Fed said South Shore's work represented a commitment by the ""business-based private sector"" to urban redevelopment.Robert P. Mayo, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said the Chicago Fed does hear ""lots of complaints"" about Treasury TT&L accounts but none have been related directly to the issue of Fed membership.""We are merely an agent for the Treasury. We don't make the rules,"" Mr. Mayo explained.In a separate development on TT&L accounts in Michigan, Edward A. Trautz, a past president of the Independent Bankers Association of America and president of the $87.4 million deposit East Lansing State Bank, East Lansing, Mich. suggested this week the Small Business Administration ask the Federal government to ""sacrifice"" interest on TT&L accounts so banks can lower lending costs to small businessmen.According to a newsletter of the Michigan Association of Community Bankers, The East Lansing banker said the SBA should ""get off the interest-payment-on-demand-deposits kick so that community banks"" can lower their costs.""With the Federal government driving up the cost of funds through interest on TT&L accounts, NOWs, PATS and money market CD's, how can small banks afford to give below market rates on a substantial portion of commercial loans,"" Mr. Trautz asked the publication.The newsletter of the Michigan independent banker group cautioned banks to give ""careful analysis"" to recent SBA recommendations urging small banks to adopt a two-tier interest system for loans.""The two tier plan is one thing to a large bank which has a high percentage of its assets invested at prime with a small percent in loans to small business and another thing to small banks which are already heavily into lending to small businesses within their communities,"" said the newsletter.Local borrowers, said the publication, can be expected to shop for the most favorable interest rates before signing a loan agreement but ""it is hard to see why a community bank should lend for less than competitive rates with resulting penalty for its own operation.""Regarding the South Shore conversion and resignation, the Chicago Fed said the South Shore withdrawal was the last Illinois bank to leave since the departure Nov. 17 of the $72 million deposit Main Bank of Chicago. The largest withdrawal during 1978 was by the $381.5 million deposit Lake View Trust & Savings Bank, Chicago."
"NSLL, HUD Offer Rehab Training",The American Banker,"May 23, 1979, Wednesday","The national savings and loan trade group will prepare course materials, recruit students and instructors, and conduct a prototype five-day session under the cooperative agreement signed last week. The course is expected to be followed by several additional training courses held in various regions of the country.""If we're going to succeed in revitalizing our cities, we have to develop a more effective housing rehabilitation industry,"" said league president Harold W. Greenwood Jr., who is also president and chairman of Midwest Federal Savings & Loan Association, Minneapolis,""As a member of president Carter's National Commission on Neighborhoods, I found that urban revitalization has been stymied by the lack of qualified builders and developers for rehabilitation projects."" he said.Undersecretary Jay Janis, who represented HUD at the signing ceremony, said, ""In community after community across the nation, both government agencies and lenders are experiencing difficulties in finding and attracting qualified builders and developers to rehabilitation projects. HUD is sponsoring this project because we're convinced that the housing rehabilitation industry must be stimulated and encouraged in order for us to make an impact on revitalizing the nation's inner cities. HUD's goal is to help that industry create a sound footing.""The course will reach persons who already are in some phase of the rehabilitation or construction business but who require more formal education and training to establish their own business or improve their existing operations, Janis said.""We are seeking persons who have the potential for operating a long-term successful business."" said Mr. Greenwood, adding that the National League is strongly committed to attracting women and minority group members.Both the President's Urban Policy and recent Congressional actions have placed increased emphasis on housing rehabilitation, said Mr. Janis. ""HUD is committed to developing a more effective partnership in the private sector between the housing rehabilitation industry and mortgage lenders.""What's needed, and what this course will help to provide, is the expertise among rehabilitation builders and developers necessary for us to effectively revitalize our cities,"" he said.The housing rehabilitation course was developed by M. Ray Niblak, a noted housing consultant, who designed and implemented a similar and highly successful program on single-family housing construction for the National Housing Partnership during 1977-78. The National League has retained Mr. Niblack to run the housing rehabilitation course.The project is part of a rehabilitation technical assistance program sponsored by HUD's Office of Urban Rehabilitation and Community Reinvestment.The National Savings and Loan League was represented at the signing ceremony by Richard Lawton, president and chairman of Washington-Lee Savings & Loan Association, McLean, Va., a subsidiary of First Financial of Virginia Corp."
Bid by Conn. CUs for Broader Lending Powers Faces Legislative Fight,The American Banker,"March 13, 1979, Tuesday","Spokesmen for the Savings Bank Association of Connecticut and the Connecticut Bankers Association told the legislature's Banks Committee at a public hearing that laws should be passed forcing large credit unions offering share drafts to pay more state taxes. In addition, the spokesmen called for laws limiting the interest that can be paid on share accounts and a return to the ""common bond"" concept in credit union membershp.""Large credit unions are operating within a legal framework designed to accommodate their smaller bretheren and have a significant advantage in competing with other types of Connecticut financial institutions,"" said Robert Eden, president of the Savings Bank Association of Connecticut.Robert Leuba, a lobbyist for the Community Services Credit Union in Groton which has $42.5 million in assets, countered that ""all competition is fair."" ""These proposals would put an unfair restriction on our growth.""In their presentations, credit union spokesmen argued that state-chartered credit unions should have parity with Federally chartered credit unions.""The authority for Connecticut statechartered credit unions to offer a line of credit to their members bridges a gap and permits credit unions to participate in a credit card program,"" said Albert M. Ferretti, credit union consultant Visa card coordinator for the Connecticut Credit Union League.The unsecured loan bill would allow credit unions to make loans of up to 10% of the paid-in umimpaired capital and surplus.""The bill would give the boards of directors the flexibility to meet the changing economic situation, not only in the nation but also in the individual credit union, and the changing needs of the credit union members,"" said Gilberg Goodgion, inhouse counsel for the Connecticut Credit Union League.In his testimony, Mr. Eden said a bill requiring members of a credit union to have a common bond of occupation, or association or to live within a well-defined neighborhood, community or rural district should be passed.Mr. Eden claimed that large credit unions are ""functioning more and more like banks without carrying the type of regulatory burdens imposed on banks and without paying any form of income tax.""Banking Commissioner David H. Neiditz, however, came to the defense of the credit unions, saying he favored their proposals.Mr. Neiditz said he opposed the proposals of the savings banks and commercial banks, although he did favor some changes in the ""common bond"" concept.""These bills are a contrived attack on our credit unions, which have served the people of our state well,"" Mr. Neiditz said. ""This attack is against the public interest,"" he added."

H. Finley, executive vice president of First State, explained his bank has an application pending with the Federal Reserve Board to form Oregon's first multibank holding company. Although the two branches of Community Bank are to be run as branches of First State, the other two banks will continue to maintain their identities as subsidiaries of the proposed holding company, he said.""They can retain their boards of directors and local autonomy,"" he said, adding that small banks have previously resisted purchase offers because of identity loss.Mr. Finley said the bank anticipates additional purchases, although no more in the next month.

NB",The American Banker,"October 1, 1979, Monday","The 12-member council was introduced to the community at a luncheon in the bank's board room last month for council members, media representatives and Mayor Joel Skornicka.Mr. Schleck commented that the council is concerned with the discouragement people feel in coping with inflation. However, he added, ""we think positively that inflation can and will be licked. And we want to help in that effort.""Mr. Schleck explained that the bank had taken the initiative for organizing the council because ""inflation is going to be present for a number of years before it can be reduced to an acceptable level. Since inflation has a very detrimental effect on our country, we want to do whatever we can to minimize that effect.""As a corporate citizen, we have a responsibility to bring you solid information. The council members will attempt to sort out meaningful suggestions for coping with inflation from techniques that have only minimal effectiveness.""ISC members are Betty Bamforth, assistant dean, student affairs, University of Wisconsin Medical School; Edith Borden, small-business ombudsman, State of Wisconsin; Jean Cowden, consumer information manager, Oscar Mayer Co.; Janet Floeter, home economist, Dane County Extension Office; Betty Kurtenacker, homemaker and past chairman of the Madison Civics Club; Richard Lawrence, vice president, community affairs, Madison Gas & Electric Co.Also, William Marshall, professor, child and family studies, UW Madison; Richard Victor, assistant state attorney general; Laureen Thorstad, homemaker; Kathy Wood. WISC-TV; Franny Van Nevel, consumer information coordinator, Office of Consumer Protection, Wisconsin Department of Justice, and Jon Udell, professor, School of Business, UW Madison.Mr. Schleck told the group that it is of little benefit for individuals to try to minimize the impact of inflation on their lives if they do not have confidence that steps are being taken to solve the problem in the long run.""The root cause of inflation is the excessive expenditures of the Federal government and the Federal deficits,"" Mr. Schleck continued. ""The Administration and Congress have taken certain significant steps to control spending but they will not continue on the course and make hard decisions without the will of the American public being imposed on them.""The council's first project is a series of monthly articles in the Wisconsin State Journal under the heading ""Inflation Survival."" The series, in space paid for by the bank, will cover coping with inflation in necessity items, such as food, shelter, energy and health care, as well as understanding inflation. Council members will develop articles.An article introducing the 12 members and the purpose of the council appeared last month.

Fed Official Hits Bank 'Finder's Fee',The American Banker,"December 10, 1979, Monday","Countering the Fed official's complaint, the $171.8 million deposit Bank of Ravenswood contends that its week-old ""bounty"" promotion is a legitimate means of attracting retail deposits for an institution deeply committed in financing community redevelopment.But James R. Morrison, senior vice president in charge of supervision and regulation for the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, labels the Bank of Ravenswood campaign as ""undesirable practice from a competitive standpoint.""The north side Chicago bank, which began its ""bounty"" advertising Dec. 2, is offering a cash reward to individuals who bring in certificate of deposit business from customers who have accounts with Loop banks or savings and loan associations.The cash ""bounty"" or ""finder's fee"" as it is commonly known, ranges from $40 for a $1,000 one-year CD to a maximum of $8,000 for an eight-year $100,000 instrument.Mr. Morrison, stressing that he is speaking on his own behalf and not necessarily for the Chicago Fed, said the Bank of Ravenswood campaign could create an unhealthy ""competitive battle"" based on ""targeting specific institutions.""In its full-page newspaper ads, the Bank of RAvenswood states that it is limiting the cash rewards for funds pulled solely out of downtown institutions.""Just bring us a north side customer from any downtown bank or savings and loan and we'll pay a finder fee for the deposit,"" states the ad, explaining that it is undertaking the program ""because north side money belongs in a north side bank.""In this way, money is brought ""back where it belongs"" so it ""can be reinvested in north side communities.""Bank of Ravenswood believes strongly in community reinvestment as our loaning record shows,"" the ad continues. ""We're willing to pay extra to bring money back so it too can be reinvested where it belongs.""The bounty, which can be made to anyone except the depositor or members of his family, is paid when the certificate of deposit account is opened.""To collect the bounty, the depositor must come to the Bank of Ravenswood, show that the money comes from downtown, open the account and we'll issue a check immediately in the finder's name. It's that simple,"" the ad concludes.The bounty, it was noted, can be paid ""to any relative, friend associate or co-worker of the depositor, a church, a civic or social organization . . . anyone who brings us a new certificate opened with money, personal or business, transferred from a downtown financial institution.""The bank's campaign, which underscores the spirited attempt by banks here and elsewhere to halt the outflow of deposits, has angered Loop bankers who, agreeing with Mr. Morrison, warn that the promotion, if successful, could trigger ""a very unpleasant trend,"" pitting large against small banks, Loop vs. suburban institutions etc.Mr. Morrison said the ""geographic"" aspects of the promotion make it undesirable, although finder's fees and premium-type campaigns oriented toward bringing in new money have been held to be legal.The $17.4 billion-deposit First National Bank of Chicago, one of the complaining banks, acknowledged that it has under way a ""finder's fee"" campaign called ""Bring a Friend.""FNB customers are rewarded up to $50 in cash for bringing in new $10,000 Treasury bill-linked CD customers with no limit above the $10,000 minimum at the rate of $5 per $1,000.FNB, however, claims its direct mail promotion, begun six weeks ago and which is slated to continue into the first quarter of 1980, is ""very much different"" than the Bank of Ravenswood's.""""As a lender to all communities in the Chicago area, we have no intention of developing any kind of campaign"" such as the Bank of Ravenswood ""to move money from one community to another.""In defending the campaign, John Obereiner, president of the Bank of Ravenswood, denied his institution seeks ""to start a rate war.""The bank's campaign, he emphasized, is simply a means of retaining funds in the community ""where they can do some good"" in rehabilitation.He accused Loop banks of having a dismal lending record in his part of the city.""In my opinion the inner city needs more banks like us,"" said Mr. Obereiner, whose bank has long been a vigorous advocate of and participates i home financing programs.He said Mr. Morrison's remarks reflect a negative attitude by the Fed toward the industry, ""contrasting sharply to that of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board which is a booster of S&Ls.""Instead of being supportive"" of programs like the Bank of Ravenswood's, the Fed as well the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. assume a ""highly restrictive"" stance and are merely ""watchdogs"" rather than being interested in promoting projects that benefit the public, he said.Mr. Obereiner said his bank has no plans to drop the campaign in the face of the Fed criticism. The Bank of Ravenswood is not a member of the Fed, but its ""bounty"" campaign received prior approval from the FDIC, he said. The campaign is slated to run through Jan. 15."

NAHRO Opposes Plan to Ban T-Es For 1-Family Homes,The American Banker,"May 1, 1979, Tuesday","NAHRO said the policy statement was made by its board of governors in response to legislation introduced last week by Rep. Al Ullman, D., Ore., chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.The first T-E housing bond issue was made by the city of Chicago in July, 1977. The Congressional Budget Office estimated recently that state and local authorities issued approximately $3.2 billion in bonds in 1978.Under the special housing programs, state and local authorities pass the proceeds from the bond issues to area banks, thrifts and mortgage bankers. The lenders then make loans to families which qualify for assistance at rates often more than two percentage points below open market rates.Mr. Ullman said he introduced his bill to prohibit the use of the bonds because they were inflationary, a drain on the Treasury, and were contrary to the Federal priority stressing multifamily housing projects for low-income renters.NAHRO said its membership included more than 2,000 agencies and 7,000 individuals involved in housing and community development.The association said Congress should permit the continued use of local T-E bonds when targetted for either low-and moderate-income housing, or to support comprehensive neighborhood and community development.NAHRO added that any Federal legislation concerning the bonds should be limited to outlining the public purposes for which they could be issued, and to identifying the public agencies which could authorize the bond issues."
Hunter Asks Focus On Retiree Housing,The American Banker,"January 19, 1979, Friday","Addressing 120 retired persons gathered from around the county for a symposium on housing for the retired, Mr. Hunter explained that FNMA was sponsoring the conference in order to learn about housing needs and preferences.""Society has tended to overlook the housing needs of middle-income retirees, or at best consigned them a low priority,"" he declared. ""FNMA belives that the private sector should take the lead in exploring the design, financial and life-style requirements of our rapidly expanding retirement community.""In the past, he said, ""programs and proposals for dealing with the housing and living requirements of retirees have come from a variety of sources, but not from the consumers themselves. I intend no criticisms of the designers, the planners and the lenders who have developed retirement housing programs now in existence, but it is our hope that we will be able to record the ideas and wisdom of those of you who are, in fact, using the product.""The retired persons at the symposium were chosen from among the approximately 1,500 people who responded to Mr. Hunter's request last summer that retired people write to FNMA about their housing concerns. They were selected to represent the retired community in general, based on where they live, their ages, incomes and races.Mr. Hunter said FNMA will publish a report on the symposium findings as well as on the input provided by all those who corresponded with the corporation about their housing concerns."
The Human Touch: One of Thrifts' Greatest Assets,The American Banker,"May 14, 1979, Monday","But what's happening to the human touch?That's a strong question coming from a banker in this computerized day and age.But is it so strange? Our customers are human beings, with human wants and needs. If we forget that, our whole banking philosophy will have regressed rather than progressed. Lest we forget, we are dealing with fellow human beings who demand personal attention, need it, and deserve it.It is all very well to take pride in the efficiencies of the computer age, but what about the individual who seeks savings investment advice, who needs loan counseling, who wants guidance in the matter of a mortgage? He needs personal attention. Attention with a human touch. He needs to sit down with a fellow human being who understands his need and can speak to it.Of course, we as savings bankers need to be concerned with developing services that benefit our customers and at the same time reduce our costs. Admittedly, computerization is part of this process.But our final concern must be one of fulfilling our customers' individual needs. And that's where the human touch comes in.We have a slogan in our industry that proclaims we are ""People Banks."" At The Morris County Savings Bank, part of our logo is a compass which, in effect, symbolizes our reaching out in all directions to serve our community.But real service to the residents of our community means speaking to them directly and personally, solving their personal problems and fulfilling their financial needs. The human touch.Mark Twain characterized a banker as ""a fellow who lends you his umbrella when the sun is shining and wants it back the minute it begins to rain."" That may have been true in the 19th century. But today, Twain would have to eat his words. Savings banks are, indeed, ""People Banks,"" preserving the human touch while seeking greater efficiency.That is why savings bankers become defensive when people tend to classify them as unfeeling and inhuman, heedless of community and personal obligations.For example, savings banks are not the cause -- as some people hold -- of the inflation that is rending our country at the moment.Savings banks are caught up in the same inflationary bind as are their customers. On the one hand, our invested dollars are being returned to us at half the value at which they stood at the time of investment. On the other hand, the dollars our customers have placed with us are being returned to them at half their value.The same situation faces savings banks as that which faces savings bank customers. Neither of us has exhibited a strong, forceful approach to those in authority. Both the consumer and banking industry have been at fault.Both of us must begin to make a strong stand. Savings banks can no longer afford to be portrayed as the bad boy on the block. We must present our case: the only money we can invest and the only money we possess is not ours -- it belongs to our depositors, to people. We have failed, it seems to me, to present our case strongly enough or with enough force to offset those who project our image as cold, inhuman, unfeeling, careless institutions lacking the human touch.For example: In the area of home ownership -- a field in which we have always prided ourselves as the vehicle that fulfills Americans' dream of a homestead -- have we really gone far enough in making this dream a reality?Have we been innovative enough in our approach in an economy that stifles young people's dreams of owning a home as their savings are depleted by inflation and an accelerated cost of living?I believe the time has arrived when we in the financial community -- and most particularly the savings banks -- must take a look at the broader aspects of community involvement. We must examine not only urban redevelopment, admittedly, a critical situation deserving attention -- but we must take a closer look at suburbia, to which little attention has been given. It, too, deserves our concern.Would it not be possible to offer innovative packages, promote them in the legislature and permit people to pay their loans in a different manner than through the antiquated amortization programs that have existed since the 1930s?Here, I believe, is where consumers --our savings bank customers -- can take up the cause. Inflation is going to be with us for a long time and the consumer can encourage savings banks' innovations to combat inflation by insisting that innovative banking legislation at least is given a hearing in the legislature. I am not suggesting a consumer-oriented banking legislation that is put before the legislature and encourage action through contact with their legislators.The press frequently reports on pending legislation, and consumers would do well to follow developments in their local newspapers.We have been extremely fortunate here in New Jersey in obtaining, over the years, legislation that has permitted us to expand into areas that are consumer-oriented. Savings banks have responded to consumer needs, for example, by providing checking accounts for families, personal, automobile, home improvement and student loans.New Jersey savings banks have made available on a constant basis mortgages for homeownership within the state.All well and good. But savings banks will have to try harder if we are to fulfill our service obligations to the communities we serve. And here, again, I return to the human touch. Communities look to us for expertise -- not just as thrift institutions, but as human, understanding individuals with the knowledge and resources to help in thinking about and planning their financial futures. No computer can achieve that human touch. No electronic gimmick can substitute for person-to-person consultation.How often have people complained about having to deal with a computer when seeking redress or explanation? It is the human touch that makes the difference.And, as human beings with financial expertise, we owe another obligation to our customers. We must be scrupulously honest in making them aware that what we have created in America is a debt society.All of us have forgotten the concepts of thrift -- the old Ben Franklin adage that a penny saved is a penny earned. That's no longer the philosophy in our debt-ridden American society. Instead, it has become a penny borrowed is a penny saved.I believe we need to turn that false philosophy around so that those who make their savings available to others are rewarded as a result -- not penalized. Today, savers not only lose the value of their dollars through inflation, but suffer additional losses through taxes. On the other hand, the borrower not only increases the value of his borrowing, but receives a tax benefit as well. Savings banks must make consumers aware of the situation and of how they, the consumers, will benefit from a reversal of this trend and a more in another direction.That is a tall order, admittedly. Consumer debt continues to grow, despite warning signs of the dangers of living on credit. But here is where savings banks can be a positive force for good.To bring this force to bear, we must remember that, although improved technology is useful and efficient, it is people we are dealing with, people we are working for and with. We must remember that corporations, industries, businesses, labor unions, welfare agencies, governments and homes are not just bricks and mortar. They comprise people.To fulfill our service role as mutual savings institutions, we must never forget that the basis of our success in driving home the philosophy of thrift lies in our relationships with people. The role of savings banks in the future, in my belief, is based on this fundamental fact. Savings banks are, indeed, ""People Banks."" Their success in the future, as it has in the past, will depend on their three greatest assets: service, community involvement, and the human touch."
Avoiding the Spotlight,The American Banker,"March 9, 1979, Friday","What NBC feared was that the application might be widely publicized and then rejected by the regulators. And the bank felt that this was a risk it was unwilling to take.It is understandable why the bank felt that its application for a branch might become an important news story. None of Memphis' three largest banks has filed a branch application in a number of years.But the reasons the bank feared rejection of its application deserve examination. They pinpoint a major problem of the banking industry today that should be rooted out, lest the entire industry lose some of its viability and strength.It was the unknown that bothered the bank's top officials.In today's regulatory environment, applications for branches become the trigger for examination of every phase of a bank's operation. And what the bank feared was that new statutes, such as the Community Reinvestment Act and other new Federal regulations might serve as the basis for a turndown of the branch application. This is even though the bank felt that it truly justified the new branch on all traditional methods of determining whether a bank was strong enough to operate one and whether the community to be served needed it.It was, then, the unknown that halted the application. For the bank and most other banks for that matter have no idea what interpretations of new legislation and regulation might be appied in examining it if it did apply for the branch.Its officers also knew that if it did not apply for the branch, then no regulators would be likely to look into the bank to see if it was meeting such new regulatory standards. Since new applications serve to trigger examinations under CRA and other new regulations, there is only one way to avoid such examinations: do not file for anything that would start such a probe.All financial executives can sympathize with this basic problem that NBC faced: a fear of the unknown.We can fight what we see.And bankers have long since adjusted to the fact that it is government's role to oppose change if it is not in the public interest. Thus, bankers for years have been buttressing their cases for branch expansion, merger applications and other changes with volumes of statistics and ideas on how the public interest will be served by the changes.But for a bank to prepare itself for the unknown is another matter.And what bankers also fear, as this newspaper has pointed out before, is that the competing banks that do not want an individual institution to have a new power are beginning to turn to the Community Reinvestment Act and other similar types of legislation themselves for reasons why the competition should be denied its application. In other words, the competing banks have started developing precedents for the government to follow in interpreting the new laws and by their own actions have made these laws more biting than they otherwise would be.Think of NBC's dilemma: It has no way of knowing what standards will be used to determine whether the bank has done its job under the new laws on the books. And it knows that if it is turned down because of one of these new standards, then the public might look at the bank and feel it is weak. For the public will assume that it is past standards that are being utilized in refusing the application, and these past standards frequently did imply the bank was weak if its application was turned down.Thus, even though the community needed the facility, the bank decided that discretion is the better part of valor, and scrapped the entire idea.One can understand the bank's decision and sympathize with it thoroughly. But one also can hope that the governmental regulators develop as soon as possible a body of standards that can be turned to judge what CRA requirements are, so that banks no longer fear the unknown.For if a bank knows what it must do and must have done in the past to satisfy these new regulatory requirements, it usually will find that it can take the chance with fair certainly that it will come out with a satisfactory conclusion."
Minn. BA Cuts Bad Check Cases,The American Banker,"January 25, 1979, Thursday","""The problem of bad checks in Minnesota has declined,"" Wayne Berthiaume, administrative vice president of MBA, told a meeting of the Chamber of Commerce in suburban Brooklyn park. ""But we cannot allow success to impede the banking industry's continuing fight against check frauds.""Mr. Berthiaume said bank staff members throughout Minnesota have been educated in new procedures that are helping banks avoid establishing accounts that result in worthless checks being written.The procedures involve new, more detailed application forms; new interview techniques to determine the checkwriting needs of applicants and to better educate them in the proper methods of handling their checking accounts; and new ways for bank employees to spot potentially troublesome accounts.""These policies and procedures already are working, and we believe their implementation will significantly reduce problems related to checking accounts. The retail merchant community benefits from these efforts through reduced badcheck losses, and from having the public better educated in proper check-writing procedures,"" said Mr. Berthiaume.""Consumer education is very important to the solution of the bad-check problem, which not only frustrates bankers and merchants but also adds to the ultimate cost of consumer goods and services. Gone are the days when a person can anticipate the number of days it will take for a check to clear, because checks are being handled more efficiently than ever before. Many are cleared the same day they are written,"" he said.Mr. Berthiaume said, ""We believe that bank education programs, including MBA's new manual on checking account procedures, together with increased cooperation between merchants and bankers, are helping to reduce the problem. The Minnesota banking community will continue to provide leadership in promoting improvements in banking services and products that meet the real needs of our customers and communities."""
Pa. Savings League Attacks Proposed Sale of Municipals to Finance Homes,The American Banker,"February 9, 1979, Friday","Cities and counties in seven states are selling the mortgage revenue bonds. Authority for the bonds already exists in several states and in others legislation is pending.Under a mortgage-backed bond program a community sells tax-exempt bonds and passes the proceeds on to local banks, thrifts and mortgage banks which originate lower-cost loans to families satisfying the criteria set by the issuer.Critics have questioned whether the bonds fund those who do not need subsidies. The Carter Administration has said it will probably seek legislation to curb the bond issues.Although ""well intentioned and appealing to a large segment of the public,"" according to a white paper by the league, the concept is ""new, experimental and potentially dangerous.""It said that bond underwriting firms that ""are encouraging this activity . . . command substantial fees for their efforts.""It also charged that the programs"" are a government-fostered income benefit to a 'chosen few' homebuyers."" It added that such funding"" is obviously impractical for all homebuyers, and the question must be asked, 'what happens when the money runs out and the long line has not been satisfied?'""The paper said, ""such a subsidized program will cause resentment among the majority of citizens required to pay market rates for mortgages because it creates a new government assistance program for a segment of citizenry not heretofore acknowledged as the appropriate beneficiaries of government largesse.""The league also noted that the Federal Home Loan Bank Board's nondiscrimination requirements specifically prohibit lenders from discriminating on the basis of ""income level or radical composition of area,"" by ""age or location factors,"" and ""through marketing policies.""The group said that if it is the intention to provide a direct benefit to home buyers and to stimulate housing ""we believe that a more meaningful program and one far less burdensome to all taxpayers would be a Federal tax credit to homebuyers.""The league suggested that the following safeguards be written into any proposed legislation:Authorities must be required to offer bonds through competing underwriters on a field bid basis.The experience and expertise of existing lending institutions in the private sector must be utilized.No one lending institution should be designated as the manager of these programs in any community, and all lending institutions should be invited to participate.To insure that subsidized funds benefit needy citizens, and are not diverted to other groups, the legislation must limit loans to families whose incomes do not exceed two-thirds of the median income of people in the area and that a minimum of one-half of these funds be directed to families in the lower third of the income range.To insure proper management in each community, a newly incorporated purpose of financing residential mortgages."
Brooklyn Group Finds Mutuals Unready For Start of Anti-Redline Regulation,The American Banker,"February 6, 1979, Tuesday","The community group members found that some banks did not have them ready and criticized those statements they did see.Three members of one active anti-redlining group, Bank on Brooklyn-Crown Heights, went Monday morning to Crown Heights branches of the $380.4 million-deposit United Mutual Savings Bank and the $892 million-deposit East New York Savings Bank. They were: Jeannette Manteau, Lillian Wright and Juliet Tomkins, an organizer for the group.The three received a relatively cordial reception at both banks. Copies of the CRA statement were available at East New York Savings, but not at United Mutual. While at the two banks' branches, Mrs. Manteau spoke by telephone with senior bank officials and received promises to send Bank on Brooklyn letters stating a willingness to meet with the community group.Neither of the two banks had posted a required notice explaining that the current CRA statement for that community was available. However, the notice for East New York Savings was on an official's desk, ready for posting.Bank on Brooklyn-Crown Heights is a project of the New York Public Interest Research Group, Inc., and has about 40 active volunteers. Mrs. Manteau said the group generally will try to persuade banks with branches in Crown Heights to improve their CRA statements, and especially to encourage them to advertise availability of mortgage loans and to publish their statements in brochure form for the public.The group has persuaded United Mutual and the $1.7 billion-deposit Metropolitan Savings Bank, to provide it with ""quarterly monitoring reports,"" which contain details of mortgage applications and loans granted. Mrs. Manteau said Bank on Brooklyn is trying to move Crown Heights' banks to make more money available for mortgage commitments and to make mortgage information available at all branches.At United Mutual's branch at Eastern Parkway and Nostrand Ave., the Bank on Brooklyn group was received by manager Paul Bordelon. He told the group the poster for the floor area would arrive later in the day and that to his knowledge no copies of the CRA statement would be available.Mr. Bordelon allowed Mrs. Manteau to phone from his office Barton C. English, the bank's treasurer, and Robert E. Weis, the savings bank's senior vice president. She was informed she could pick up a copy of the CRA statement later in the day. Later, discussing the fact the statement was required when the mutual opened, she said privately that in dealing with banks she often encountered the attitude of ""wait until we get around to it.""At East New York, the Bank on Brooklyn group spoke to an assistant vice president who gave them a copy of a 13-page CRA statement for $1. She questioned the bank's policy to require a borrower on conventional mortgage loans on one-and two-family homes to be a depositor of the bank for at least one year and wanted the interest rate on such loans to be specified.The Bank on Brooklyn group proceeded to a Rockefeller Center branch of the $4.1 billion-deposit Dime Savings Bank of New York where the Coalition Against Redlining held a half-hour demonstration. There, coalition officials urged the Federal regulatory agencies to enforce the CRA and to pressure banks to comply.Coalition officials were critical of a very brief CRA statement which they picked up at the $521.8 million-deposit North Side Savings Bank, the Bronx, for failing to mention multifamily mortgage and business loans, which they said were important credit needs in the Bronx.Participating in the noontime demonstration was Gale Cincotta, leader of National People's Action, a nationwide coalition of neighborhood groups which the previous day held a national leadership meeting here. Ms. Cincotta said that in the months ahead NPA would gather data of banks' compliance with CRA for presentation to Federal banking regulators. If banks do not comply with CRA, she said, NPA would press for credit allocation legislation, which could require that a percentage of banks' assets be invested in the neighborhoods they serve."
The Savings Syndrome,The American Banker,"May 2, 1979, Wednesday","In reaction to the changing savings environment, most segments of the industry are planning their strategies.They will be attempting to avoid a drain on profits and hoping to set up a profitable or break-even offer to consumers. Yet one of the hardest-hit segments of the industry will be the community banker. This group remembers well the struggle involved with the introduction of the automatic transfer service. Big banks pushed for ATS, moved ahead fast and left the small banks in their wake. As the industry moves to offer small-saver certificates, plus a nationwide negotiable order of withdrawal account, we know who will suffer the most -- the community banker.How can the community banker attempt to gain an edge on this ensuing dilemma? Let us analyze some of the conditions that will exist during the next six months:Regulatory agencies and Congress will no doubt offer some kind of relief to the small depositor. Then there is a myriad of deposit relationships that can be formed from offering together, or separately, certain plans. Also, bankers anticipate an interest-bearing transaction account that will come on the scene after due deliberation.Knowing that all of the above considerations are at hand, we can predict with accuracy that the consumer will have a big problem: confusion. The agony will be experienced in the new accounts and customer representative areas.What can the community banker do now to prepare for this advent? Here are seven points that can help the community banker take action:
1. Peer Group PerformanceHow well does your bank perform against others with like characteristics? What is the normal cost of funds for an organization like yours? Are you better or worse and how far are you from becoming a high-performance bank, earning more than 1.5% on assets? Various reports and data are now available for this kind of comparison. Before you can adopt a meaningful liabilities strategy for your organization, you should know your own strengths and weaknesses in your liability management and deposit-generating areas.
2. Account ProfitabilityHow many of your savings accounts account for what share of your savings deposits? What share of your checking accounts generate what share of demand deposit accounts? How many accounts by stratified balance groupings have what percentage of your total deposits?When this kind of analysis can be undertaken and reviewed, bankers are then in a position to determine what kind of pricing structure should be needed for savings, checking and the future NOW account.
3. Pricing New ServicesInstead of referring to big competition down the street, as so many banks did when they figured their proposals for automatic transfer, what kind of pricing should you undertake for your own market area? How will the products be configured? Will there be a discount offered on checking for savings balances?Will the new certificates of deposits be tied in with these kinds of balances? Will the NOW account be linked to a savings account? What kind of price break do you give a customer who does more business with you?
4. New Account Desk MeltdownHistorically new account people were order takers, filling out details concerning a customer's desire for some kind of investment or transaction account. Usually the pick of products was not more than four or five savings accounts and two or three checking accounts. In the future, the number of savings options will grow to 13 or 15 and the checking possibly to five. Rather than order takers, the new accounts people must become financial counselors. Are your people ready?
5. Savings and Liability PolicyJust as it has a loan policy, each bank should have a detailed written policy that governs liability management. What portion of your deposits do you maintain in government funds? Corporate funds? 5% passbook and other time instruments? What should your deposit mix be in light of your market environment and asset base?
6. Train, Train, TrainIn order to gear up your bank to offer financial counseling, the products have to be well defined. They must not create confusion in the marketplace. Your personnel should be extremely knowledgeable on how to present easy-to-understand solutions for a very complex subject, coupled with a generous ability to cross-sell services.To prepare these programs and activities for effective implementation, lead time is required. Now is the time to plan --and fall of 1979. We thought it was hard to explain automatic transfer; that will be easy compared to giving advice to a potential customer on how best to handle his deposits. A clear distinction between a checking and savings account will be less evident. Your personnel have to understand the small nuances and differences that all the certificates offer. And they will have to be prepared to explain how they should be linked with a transaction account and eventually a credit account.
7. Time Is Running OutSoon all financial institutions will be offering similar products, sometimes through shared automatic teller machines. Banks used to be unique. . . different from savings and loans and credit unions. In the future, this will not be so. While banks still have a monopoly on the transaction account, all effort should be made to use that as a wedge in cross-selling other services and arranging tie-in promotions and price discounts. These actions will shore up your customers before they have an opportunity to switch to other institutions which offer similar products.Don't cause a meltdown at the new account desk because of your failure to plan ahead and get your act together."
Section 8 Provides Unique Opportunity for Thrifts,The American Banker,"August 1, 1979, Wednesday","One tool that can be applied to meeting this challenge was provided in the Federal Housing and Community Development Act of 1974. Section Eight is the portion of that act which establishes the primary national source of assistance for construction, rehabilitation and maintenance of rental and cooperative housing for low and moderate income people. In essence, Section Eight provides a Federal guarantee of rental income to a property sufficient to cover amortization and debt service, operating expenses and a fair return on equity. The program is available to private developers, not-for-profit sponsors and public housing agencies through the area offices of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).Under the terms of a Section Eight ""Housing Assistance Payments Contract,"" the Federal government makes a commitment to contribute annual rent subsidies that should represent the difference between the established cost of developing and operating a building and the portion of that cost which can be carried by rent payments from low and moderate income tenants. The Section Eight program may be used with conventional financing or combined with an FHA insurance program, local tax exempt bond issue or GNMA tandem plan, depending on the circumstances of the individual project. Section Eight may be applied to all the apartments in a given development or to some portion of the apartments. Under what is called the ""existing"" program, the Section Eight subsidy may be assigned to individual low income tenants in an otherwise unsubsidized building, in which case the subsidy ""moves out"" with the tenant. All properties receiving Section Eight assistance must be built in conformance with HUD's minimum property standards and meet strict management, marketing and accounting requirements.Anchor Savings Bank is a $1.7 billion mutual savings institution chartered in New York State with headquarters in a ""transitional"" Brooklyn neighborhood called Sunset Park. The bank presently has 22 offices scattered throughout New York City and five countries in the greater metropolitan area. A significant portion of Anchor's mortgage portfolio is invested in older buildings which are experiencing serious problems of physical and economic obsolescence. Market rents in many aging neighborhoods can no longer support the extraordinary expense of new construction or rehabilitation. In extreme cases, private owners are walking away from their properties and leaving the bank, as mortgagor, with responsibility for disposition of the building and any remaining tenants. This growing pattern of deterioration and property abandonment has resulted in financial losses to the bank. Of more concern, however, is the negative impact on entire communities in which abandonment of even a single property generates a crisis in confidence among other property owners, businessmen and tenants that can precipitate overnight devastation of a formerly stable area.During the 1970s, Anchor Savings Bank and other urban-based thrifts found themselves inextricably involved in this process of urban deterioration which, in most cases, the private sector was helpless to reverse wuthout some form of public intervention and assistance. This was the context in which Anchor first took a serious look at the Federal Section Eight program. While various forms of tax abatement and interest subsidy could provide useful incentives to residential redevelopment, abandoned buildings in distressed neighborhoods usually require the ""deep"" subsidy available only through Section Eight.The bank made its first Section Eight commitments in 1977, for new construction of non-profit senior citizen housing projects financed by New York State Housing Finance Agency tax exempt bond issues. Anchor became the lead bank in private placement of a $22.5 million bond issue for the first Section Eight elderly housing project in Brooklyn, followed by similar participation in four additional elderly housing developments around New York State. The experience in appraisal and underwriting for these uninsured bond issues provided the boiler plate for Anchor's move into construction and permanent commitments for a variety of Section Eight projects that include FHA insured and conventional loans for rehabilitation and new construction projects serving low and moderate income families, as well as senior citizens. Anchor also applied the ""existing"" Section Eight program to a moderate rehabilitation venture undertaken jointly with Guardian Life Insurance Company of America, acquiring subsidy for those low income tenants-in-place who could not afford a restructured rent.In review of a Section Eight loan application, the key document is the agreement to enter into a Housing Assistance Payments contract made between HUD and the sponsor/owner of the proposed project prior to construction. This agreement sets out the terms of a HAP contract that is automatically renewed every five years for the life of the mortgage, or up to 20 years on an FHA-insured mortgage. It establishes the ""contract rent"" for a particular building in a given area, sufficient to cover development, financing and operating expenses. The contract allows for annual review of operating expenses and proportionate adjustment of the rent to assure an adequate flow of income to the development. It stipulates that the owner/manager must collect up to 25% of a tenant's income in rent (minus deductions for essential utilities), and requisition the balance of the contract rent from HUD. Just as the contract rent can be adjusted annually, so also tenant incomes are periodically reviewed and the assessment of rent adjusted to reflect changes in their economic status.While skilled management is vital to any housing, under Section Eight the quality of management takes on a particularly crucial dimension.Meeting terms of the HAP contract, determining eligibility and rent for each individual tenant, and processing the monthly paperwork involved in requisitions, certifications and drawdowns presents a potential management nightmare. Adjustment in annual HUD contributions to reflect rising costs are based on documented and verifiable expenses that are scrutinized on a line-by-line basis. Any failure to comply with HUD's standards for tenant eligibility, affirmative fair marketing, fiscal and administrative record-keeping, and proper maintenance of the physical plant can jeopardize the contract. As a consequence, the caliber and experience of the sponsor/owner and manager of a Section Eight project become an overriding criterion for responsible investment.There are, however, a variety of safeguards that are built into or can be applied to a Section Eight project. In the first place, whether FHA insured or conventionally financed, HUD provides a screening process for developers, sponsors, architects and contractors which includes detailed mortgage credit, architectural and cost analysis. For insured mortgages, HUD provides ongoing supervision of construction and management. The HAP agreement can, with HUD approval, be pledged as security for the permanent loan. HUD also allows the HAP contract to be amended to assign the permanent lender the power of attorney for purposes of protecting the five-year renewal option. Federal payments can be assigned directly to the lender, to safeguard the ""first call"" on building income for debt service. Debt service escrow and reserve accounts are established in accordance with the lender's policy. In addition, HUD provides an allowance for vacant apartments equal to 80% of the contract rent for up to 60 days and for 100% of debt service for an additional 12 months. With HUD approval, the HAP contract continues in force under a change in ownership or during a receivership process. All these considerations are vital in determining the security of the investment. When construction or permanent financing is backed by FHA insurance or the moral obligation of a local housing authority, there is additional safety.As for a yield on a Section Eight investment, conventionally financed projects are negotiated between borrower and lender without HUD involvement. Every HUD area office has the prerogative, however, to preclude conventional financing in high interest rate periods.For an insured project, HUD currently allows 9 1/2% of the mortgage. Additional points necessary to discount the loans to market rates are not mortgageable and must be paid by the owner, generally through proceeds of the sale of limited partnerships. HUD requires a construction completion bond, which is also a mortgageable item, and a 2% letter of credit from the developer.To apply Section Eight effectively as a tool for serving specific neighborhoods, it is necessary for the lending bank to be an early partner in the conceptualization and development of a comprehensive redevelopment program. Having been involved in the life of the Brooklyn community of Sunset Park for many years, Anchor was in a position to identify a non-profit community organization that would be a responsible sponsor for a local rehabilitation program. In 1976, the bank offered to join with a non-profit group in a pilot Section Eight application for an abandoned 20-mile unit building on which the bank held a first mortgage. Anchor donated the funds necessary to clear title to the vacant property and provided a commitment for conventional financing, which resulted in an allocation of Section 8 funds. Construction is now half-completed on the gut rehabilitation of the pilot building. Anchor is providing a construction loan of $500,000 secured by a 25% front-end equity investment on the part of the sponsor and general contractor and other pertinent pledges.The fruit of this initial effort has multiplied throughout the community, with subsequent commitments of Section Eight assistance to renovate some forty additional buildings. This program should effectively wipe out the abandonment problem in the area and, in conjunction with other local improvement efforts, reverse a decade of neighborhood decline and restore a healthy climate for conventional private ownership and investment. The community-based sponsor, which has been a constructive force in the neighborhood for more than 10 years, will manage the renovated buildings. In addition to providing decent housing at affordable rents, the Section Eight development program is bringing hundreds of jobs to the neighborhood. Construction starts have already stabilized local merchants and homeowners, who were the most threatened by the spectre of abandoned buildings and the seemingly inevitability of continued decline. The new apartments, with the special attraction of rent which never exceeds 25% of tenant income, are a magnet for keeping senior citizens in the community and for drawing young, working families back to the area. Finally, private owners of residential buildings which require only moderate upgrading have been encouraged to reinvest in their own property on the promise of improved conditions in the rental and resale market for the neighborhood as a whole.In summary, the Section Eight program represents a unique opportunity for savings banks to assume an aggressive role in revitalization of our most troubled urban neighborhoods. Applied judiciously, and in partnership with responsible sponsors and managers, Section Eight is the most useful tool for meeting our obligations to the diverse constituents that increasingly look to the thrift industry for leadership in the area of community preservation and redevelopment."
Citibank Helping Mutuals Finance Stabilizing of Bklyn. Neighborhood,The American Banker,"May 15, 1979, Tuesday","Citibank's role in this potential partnership with savings banks is to package and structure the loan, expedite its processing through a labyrinth of city programs, and to make the short-term rehab loans. Thus, Citibank staffers with expertise in These complicated programs cope with the intricacies and details for savings banks, which do not have the staff to do so, Citibank officials explained.The $60.8 billion-deposit commercial bank has received commitment letters to provide long-term financing from the $1.7 billion-deposit Metropolitan Savings Bank, Brooklyn. Other savings banks are expected to refinance loans which they originated or which other thrifts originated.Citibank, which started a pilot project in Flatbush in January, 1978, in order to determine if it could help stabilize a transitional neighborhood, is working on 12 multifamily buildings in Flatbush. Refinancing is necessary on five of them; the others require new loans.There's a unique role for Citibank, too. It works with owners of the multifamily buildings from the very beginning of the loan and nurses the project along. Instead of leaving the owner to do all the work, Citibank helps restructure rents, works with contractors and looks after much of the paperwork.Why is Citibank willing to package and expedite loans for owners and savings banks -- without charge? Marguerite O. Pitts, a member of the project, said Citibank's willingness stems from the fact Citibank is conducting a research and demonstration project in Flatbush to determine how it can stabilize a neighborhood and whether it can improve its marketplace, an improvement which would increase its potential business.On the other hand, Citibank's interest on rehab loans normally is prime plus 2% or 13 3/4% currently.Mrs. Pitts, manager of real estate lending for the 15-month-old project, gave a presentation about the project to savings bankers at a recent seminar about marketing and the Community Reinvestment Act. She had a brief, friendly sales pitch: ""The easiest way for you to make a CRA investment is to join us in Flatbush.""Later, in an interview, she explained why savings bankers should be interested in multifamily loans. ""by financing the rehabilitation of buildings now, you are putting these buildings back on their feet for the long term. If you let them deteriorate, you're making sure they will be a poor asset in the future.""She added she is also telling the savings bankers that they should take advantage of the city's Participation Loan program, while it is offered.Mrs. Pitts also is pointing out that other banks are investing in multifamilies and that the 12 buildings that Citibank and the savings banks are working on are concentrated in two small areas in Flatbush.Three of seven pilot project members and two at Citibank Community Development have expertise in PLP and related city programs.There are three key ingredients in the multifamily partnership of Citibank and savings banks: the PLP; the city's J51 tax abatement program, and rent restructuring.Though few loans have been processed through PLP since it began four years ago, most of the 12 multifamilies are being rehabbed through PLP. Here is a typical example of how the rehab project might be structured: a savings bank holds a $200,000 existing mortgage on a building; Citibank makes a $600,000 loan for rehab work; a long-term mortgage totals $800,000 -- half of which is provided by the savings bank and half provided through PLP.Flatbush housing is mostly multifamily, with 88% of its residents living in dwellings with three or more units. Many multifamily buildings require major heating, wiring and other systems work. The costs of such rehab are so high that rents would be unaffordable without PLP.The J51 program abates part or all of a building's current taxes for up to 20 years, depending on the amount and type of rehab. Another aid in multifamily rehab is provided by the Rehabilitation Mortgage Insurance Corp. for up to half of the long-term mortgages issued by private lenders in some neighborhoods.This program, known as REMIC, is city-funded.Charles Forsberg, president of Citicorp Community Development, said in an interview that the Flatbush project staff approved, and CCD booked, a participation in a long-term mortgage loan on a multifamily in Flatbush. He said that such participation was unusual and added the bank would be more willing to make long-term mortgages to facilitate conversion of a rental to a co-op building.Discussing the Flatbush project, he said: ""We try to persuade everyone to take a long-term view of their community."" He added the bank's message to investors in Flatbush was to ""stand fast.""Two vitally important factors in the success of multifamily buildings, he said, are tenant selection and property management. His subsidiary has provided construction loans totaling about $2 million in PLP rehab of three multifamily buildings, two in Brooklyn and one in Manhattan.The three buildings were rehabbed with tenants in place -- something while proved ""very difficult,"" he said. In the future, the bank may have to hire a consulting firm which would inform tenants regularly about rehab plans and costs to them, he said.Mrs. Pitts said the pilot project has been working closely on possible multifamily rehab projects with the $4.1 billion-deposit Dime Savings Bank of New York, Brooklyn, and the $930.8 million-deposit Independence Savings Bank, Brooklyn.Owners were being referred to the pilot project, she said, by five community groups, particularly the Flatbush Development Corp, and by work of mouth.Of the five buildings requiring refinancing, she said, two are very run down and one is in foreclosure. She said rent control was not a serious problem in the multifamily situation in Flatbush because fast tenant turnover was allowing increases in rents."
Fed Launches Geocoding Project to Tract Credit Actions by Neighborhood,The American Banker,"March 26, 1979, Monday","The procedure, called geocoding, is being used to determine compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act and civil rights regulations. Geocoding was authorized for Fed examiners early in February, and its use varies at different Fed district banks.""Geocoding is the most objective criteria we've got"" to measure CRA performance, said a Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta official.In geocoding, examiners take addresses from a bank's record of credit extensions, applications and denials, and plot these addresses on a census tract map, CRA statement map or ordinary street map.This gives a graphic picture of a bank's lending practices based on a sample of a bank's mortgage and other types of lending.A Federal Reserve Bank of New York spokesman said last week that that district bank plans to use geocoding in all CRA and civil rights exams. ""It's a learning process and we'll evaluate it as we go,"" he said. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York currently is using geocoding in a consumer exam of a medium-sized commercial bank, the first in which it has employed geocoding. FRB Atlanta examiners have used geocoding in three of about 10 exams since it was authorized, the Atlanta official said.The Fed currently is in the process of increasing the total of its consumer examiners from 70 to 130 in order to examine for compliance with CRA and such civil rights regulations as Equal Credit Opportunity and Fair Housing statutes, a Washington regulatory source said.The Fed's estimated 1979 budget contains a $1.6 million increase for the planned increase in examiners and related support staff, he said.Examination time will increase about 33% to 50% if geocoding is used, five Fed district banks estimated on the basis of a sample exam conducted last November. The New York Fed official estimated it would double.The New York Fed spokesman said that the authorization of geocoding was part of a strengthened CRA-civil rights compliance program, though its use was not described in the press release about the program early in February. Geocoding has been a controversial subject at the three other Federal banking agencies, largely because of its expense. Those agencies are studying the geocoding idea or using it on a very limited basis.The spokesman said that geocoding findings will be only one of several factors which will be used to evaluate CRA performance and said he doubted there was an alternative to geocoding.Geocoding examiners will have a key tool in the demographic information which currently is being distributed to examiners throughout the Fed system. They contain extensive detail about the income, racial, home ownership and housing stock characteristics of many neighborhoods according to census tract.This demographic information is useful in determining whether a census tract is low-and moderate-income and whether such a tract has been excluded from a bank's community, the New York spokesman said. In this demographic data, the Fed uses the Department of Housing and Urban Development's definition of low-and moderate-income census tract as one in which median family income is less than 80% of that median for the entire standard metropolitan statistical area.The Fed's demographic information is contained in four computer printouts and broken down according to low to moderate and upper income census tracts, zip code and county. The printouts are based on a tape provided by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. The tape is based on 1970 census data.Geocoding examiners will start with real estate loans but will also look at the entire range of a bank's lending -- small business, small farm, home improvement, credit card and car loans, Fed regulators said. They generally will take a representative sample of each type of loan and will look further if they find a questionable pattern. ""If we found all loans were in one direction, we would ask why,"" the spokesman said.A lack of applications from low- to moderate-income neighborhoods or a high percentage of denials there ""would tell us to look harder,"" one Fed official said. Examiners also will look for signs a bank is discouraging people from making formal applications or that real estate brokers are steering homebuyers from a bank because of its loan policy, he said.Examiners will use an ""effects test"" of bank policy to see if the effect of a policy is that a bank does not make loans in a certain area, he said. Geocoding examiners reportedly will concentrate on a bank's actual lending experience and will plot the loan approvals and denials contained in the bank's Home Mortgage Disclosure Act statement.The Atlanta official -- who said the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta plans to geocode ""when we feel it's necessary"" --calls geocoding ""a comprehensive, sincere and flexible effort to enforce compliance in an even-handed way"" and pointed out that none of the costs of geocoding are being put onto the banking industry. However, he noted that reserve banks will reevaluate CRA and civil rights exam procedures this summer.The Fed examines state-chartered member banks, which traditionally have not been heavily involved in residential mortgage lending, the historic area of concern behind CRA. But commercial banks can help meet community credit needs by making other-than-mortgage loans and by other activities, such as lending their management expertise to community development efforts and by helping a community obtain government grants, the Atlanta official said.""CRA performance will be important to all financial institutions"" -- not just to the thrifts which have received most of the attention since CRA was enacted, he said."
"Mo. Combines State Time Deposits into 1 Package to Spur Bonds, Student Loans",The American Banker,"August 21, 1979, Tuesday","Called ""Missouri Deposits for Missouri Projects,"" the program allows the state to deposit idle funds in banks that purchase specific bonds or make Federally insured student loans.The restructured setup combines the state's time-deposit programs for industrial development, community development and student loans, with a relatively new Missouri Bond Incentive Program.The bond incentive program was developed earlier this year to promote bank purchases of industrial development and other bonds that the Missouri Division of Commerce and Industrial Development says will aid in the growth and stability of Missouri communities and the state as a whole.""It's kind of a sweetener,"" said Missouri State Treasurer James I. Spainhower, who developed the program. ""What we're saying is, if the revenue issue is sound and helpful to the community, we'll put half of it in a time deposit. This might encourage a bank to go ahead and do it.""Under the bond program, Missouri banks are urged to invest not only in industrial development bonds but also in bonds issued by the Missouri Housing Development Commission, the Missouri Environmental Improvement Authority, the Missouri Board of Public Buildings and the Missouri Health and Educational Facilities Authority.Banks purchasing any of these bonds are entitled to $1 in state time deposits for $2 of bonds purchased if the bank has maintained a 50% loans-to-deposits ratio. The time deposit is for a maximum of one year. However, when the year is up, the state treasurer will renew that portion of the state deposit representing 50% of the outstanding face value of the bond for an additional year if the state's cash flow permits. The interest rate paid the state for its funds is based on the average for one-year U.S. Treasury bills.Mr. Spainhower expects the bond incentive program to become ""one of the most popular"" in the state's time-deposit program. Meanwhile, the state's Student Loan Time Deposit Program, begun five years ago by Mr. Spainhower, remains the most popular of the state programs.Currently, nearly $14 million in state funds are deposited under the student loan program. To qualify for that program, a bank must have 50% of its total deposits in loans, and a minimum of 1% of its loan portfolio must be Federally insured student loans.Any bank meeting the requirements receives a state deposit that matches dollar-for-dollar the total amount granted by the bank in student loans. The maximum student loan deposit allowed to a single bank is $1 million.""This plan continues to be attractive to banks that demonstrate an above-average participation in the Federal insured student loan program,"" said Mr. Spainhower.""The deposit provide banks with additional funds for loans, enabling these financial institutions to make a modest profit while at the same time perform an extremely vital and commendable public service,"" he added.While the time-deposit programs are popular with some banks, others have shunned them, and at least one state newspaper has upbraided the program. A prominent St. Louis County banker criticized the program, saying his bank did not need any incentive from the state to invest in its own community. And a newspaper in Columbia, Mo., criticized the program, saying the state should invest its idle funds whereever it could get the highest interest rates."
State St. Quits Bid to Shut Unit,The American Banker,"October 19, 1979, Friday","The bank wanted to close its oldest branch in the Fenway section at the busy corner of Massachusetts Ave. and Boylston St.Bank officials said they first want to talk with more groups in the area.Daniel Morley, vice president of public affairs, said the bank asked Gerald T. Mulligan, State Commissioner of Banks, to postpone a hearing on the closing. ""There was some concern in the community regarding the implications of this,"" Mr. Morley explained.Mr. Mulligan, however, said he is treating the request as a withdrawal.""The bank has handled this relationship very poorly,"" he said, believing the request for postponement came because ""they realized they had mishandled it.""The Massachusetts Urban Reinvestment Advisory Group, a consumer-oriented group which monitors bank activities, helped lead community opposition to the scheduled closing.James Carras, MURAB director, said that while his group is happy that State Street has, for now, changed its mind, the neighborhood would be willing to let the bank close its huge structure in the Fenway area if another branch would be opened nearby.Mr. Morley, however, said ""I don't know if we feel this is a situation that requires a compromise,"" and pointed out that even if the Fenway branch closed that it would be consolidated with another branch five blocks away in Copley Square.Mr. Carras said his group and others will continue to watch what State Street does about the branch. If the bank persists in trying to close it, he added, the group will challenge its future requests for branches or mergers under the Community Reinvestment Act.""I don't think they are waiting for this to cool off. They know we are out there. What we are really looking for is a compromise,"" he said.The bank wants to close its branch primarily to sell the structure to a nearby music school, and Mr. Carras said MURAB is willing to let that sale go unchallenged if State Street does not pull out of the area entirely.Hugh McCormack of MURAB said State Street has never disputed the branch is profitable. ""What they are saying is that it is not profitable enough.""According to statistics compiled by MURAB, the total amount lent in adjacent Fenway census tracts by Boston banks from July, 1976, to July, 1978, was $14.051 million.Of that amount, he asserted, $36,989 has been lent by State Street in mortgages and home renovation loans.Mr. Carras said a subsequent survey of 35 area small businesses has shown only one received a business loan from State Street while nearly one-half the merchants complained they were actively discouraged by bank officials when filling out applications.Mr. Carras said, ""They told me, 'I went in, I was discouraged.' Most didn't even know the bank was closing and the ones who went in to see State Street said they had really bad problems.""Bank officials have contended that there was sufficient legal notice as required by law, and that all its branches had notices stating there was a request pending to close the Fenway branch."
"Smith, Knoxville Banker, Resigns from Expo 82 Panel; Urges Broader Spectrum",The American Banker,"August 27, 1979, Monday","Mr. Smith's resignation came amid reports that he and other bankers, concerned about the future of the project, have asked that Jake Butcher, chairman of United American Bank here, also step down from the committee.Saying that those reports have been exaggerated, Mr. Smith denied that such a request has been made. Instead, he said, the committee will soon restructure itself to include more community involvement.""We're not trying to discredit Jake,"" Mr. Smith said. ""He has done more than anyone else to get this project going, particularly in lining up Federal and statewide support.""Mr. Smith tendered his resignation following a meeting of the $343 million-deposit Park National's board.""My board of directors decided that as the chief executive officer of one of the banks that will be lending money for the project, I really should not remain in a leadership role with Expo 82,"" Mr. Smith said. ""I believe Jake and his directors are leaning toward the same decision.""Because of what he termed as exaggerated and misleading news reports, Mr. Butcher declined comment on the status of the management committee. But a spokesman said that Mr. Butcher had begun planning for a reorganization of the committee earlier this year.""This change has been in the works for some time and was something that Mr. Butcher felt would be appropriate when other banks began placing their funds into the project,"" Wendell Potter, a spokesman for Mr. Butcher, said.United American Bank earlier lent $900,000 to launch the project. Most of those funds have now been expended, Expo officials said.Mr. Smith and chief executive officers of Valley Fidelity National Bank, First Tennessee Bank NA and First American Bank, all of Knoxville agreed to advance $200,000 they had promised for the project, contingent upon the management committee restructuring being completed within 30 days.""This is a very complicated project that will require broad-based support from the local community and our entire region,"" Mr. Smith said. ""Our local banks which are supporting the project don't want to put any more dollars in unless we're sure the project will be completed.""He said he envisions a new management committee that would be devoid of bankers. ""Some bankers might be included on the project's board of directors, but I think it would be better to have nonbankers making the day-to-day decisions.""Other sources said that besides the management restructuring the Knoxville banks asked, as a condition of their further participation, that a $25 million financial package from private sources be completed by Sep. 30 and that assurances be given that the Federal government will follow through on an agreement for $12.45 million in Federal grants for Expo.Besides the Knoxville banks, a group of other Tennessee banks and money center banks have agreed to lend Expo the $25 million. Expo leaders also have received promises from state and local governments for funding and are attempting to conclude a separate financing agreement for a $15 million hotel to be built in conjunction with the exposition complex."
Europeans Like Miller Appointment; Changes Unsettling,The American Banker,"July 23, 1979, Monday","Mr. Miller, on the other hand, has acquired a stronger reputation in the European financial community, although one that stops well short of idolatory. However, the manner of the change left the European community somewhat puzzled and uncertain, especially the failure to announce an immediate successor to Mr. Miller as Chairman of the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors, a job which many Europeans regard as being at least as important as that of Secretary of the Treasury.Because the Washington reshuffle was incomplete, it gave an impression here of being hurried, flustered and not fully thought out. Whether that impression remains will depend on the administration's choice for the chairmanship of the Fed.The rise in the Federal Reserve discount rate had been widely anticipated here and at least some bankers had expected it to be a full point. On balance, therefore, the dollar's present difficulties do not seem to be at an end as yet. Its position seems to remain fragile and heavily dependent on further developments in Washington.The dollar made a small recovery against other major currencies on European exchanges Friday on a combination of the 1/2 point rise in the New York Federal Reserve Bank's discount rate to 10%, modest central bank intervention, and the personnel changes announced in Washington Thursday night.Bankers here were unsure which of those factors was mainly responsible for taking some of the pressure off the dollar.Indeed, some went further and attributed the dollar's apparent stabilization mainly to market expectations of another possible ""package"" of American economic measures over the weekend, on the model if not the scale of last November's.At the close of trading here Friday, the dollar was at 1.8185 Deutschemarks, up from DM 1.81 Thursday. Against the Swiss franc, the U.S. currency finished at Sw. fr. 1.6435, up from Sw.fr. 4.6330.The dollar was quoted Friday at 4.2402 French francs, up from Fr.fr. 4.2115 Thursday, at 29.06 Belgian francs, up from B.fr. 28.93, at 818 lira, up from 1.1. 814.25 and at 216.92 yen, up from Y215.35.The Canadian dollar ended the day at 85.85 U.S. cents, compared with 85.82 U.S. cents a day earlier.Gold drifted aimlessly in dull trading ending at $298.25 an ounce, down from is morning fixing at $298.50 and its Thursday closing price of $298.75.The dollar's weakness and uncertainty over the changes in Washington pushed Eurodollar bond and note prices down last week.In discussing the outlook for Eurodollar bonds, underwriters and dealers were pessimistic, noting that the dollar's weakness is a threat to the orderliness of the market. Bankers questionned whether central banks could keep the U.S. currency stable as intervention tends to increase the money supply of the intervening countries and therefore cause inflation."
FHLBB Omits Mtge. Criterion for Federal Savings Banks,The American Banker,"March 9, 1979, Friday","The proposal also would not curb the investment authority of Federal mutual savings banks.The regulation would, however, require Federal mutuals to adopt voting privileges for their depositors and borrowers. Industry sources said they were not surprised the FHLBB included this requirement, but added that this could be a deterrent for some mutual savings banks interested in Federal charters.A spokesman for the United States League of Savings Associations said here Thursday the S&L trade group was disappointed the FHLBB proposal does not include a formula for determining savings banks' mortgage lending commitment.""We still have the concern that there will be no more commitment to housing on the part of mutual savings banks,"" he said. ""The case-by-case basis is something we will look at carefully because we felt a more ongoing commitment to housing was intended.""The FHLBB said it would accept comments on the proposal for 30 days following its publication in the Federal Register.Mutual savings banks become eligible to switch to Federal charters March 11, 1978 as a result of legislation passed by Congress last October. The FHLBB is charged with drafting rules and regulations to govern the examination and operation of mutuals under Federal charters.There are approximately 450 mutual savings banks in 17 states, mostly in the Northeast.Louis H. Nevins, vice president and director of the Washington office of the National Association of Mutual Savings Banks, said Thursday the trade group is ""very pleased the Bank Board went along with us in not insisting on a numerical housing requirement.""Mr. Nevins said he knew the FHLBB plan to require depositor-borrower voting for trustees ""was a likelihood,"" but added that the agency proposal to phase-in a voting system over a six year period was preferable to one which would have called for an immediate election of all trustees.He said the expense of a depositor voting system and fears of management turnovers could be reasons some mutual savings banks will not seek Federal charters, but added that liberalized branching capabilities for savings banks in certain states probably will be the major inducement for converting.Mr. Nevins said he was unsure how many mutuals would seek Federal charters.""It could grow, it could become very attractive,"" Mr. Nevins said, ""but we don't know.""According to the proposal, the FHLBB would determine on a case-by-case basis whether each savings bank applying for a Federal charter was serving the home financing and general credit needs of its community.The FHLBB would use Community Reinvestment Act statements, reports on local market conditions and loan underwriting standards in determining the extent of service to the community, the agency said.The proposal also said mutuals under Federal charters would be subject to the rules and regulations which govern Federal S&Ls, except for those activities and investments recognized as unique to mutual savings banks."

FHLBB Lets Beneficial Add Tex. S&L HC,The American Banker,"April 6, 1979, Friday","Concerns about the size and activities of Beneficial, however, prompted the FHLBB to add restrictions on the operation of the holding company for the purpose of ensuring that it services the needs of its subsidiary S&L and the community.For example, the board of directors of Beneficial will be required to ratify a Community Reinvestment Act statement and a loan underwriting policy as drafted by the $519.6 million-deposit First Texas Savings Association, Dallas, and approved by the agency. First Texas Savings is the subsidiary.The FHLBB also will monitor the debt-servicing plans of Beneficial to ensure no undue pressure would be placed on the subsidiary S&L, although the holding company would not need prior approval to incur debt.Beneficial is a consumer finance and merchandising holding company as well as a bank holding company. Its bank subsidiary is the $29.2 million-deposit Peoples Bank & Trust Co., Wilmington.Robert H. McKinney, chairman of the FHLBB, said at the Board meeting he voted in favor of the acquisition ""somewhat reluctantly.""He explained he was concerned about ""the disappearance of local control"" of S&Ls and the impact on community service.""If major corporations are going to move in on these areas, the Bank Board is going to take this very seriously,"" he said.An FHLBB official interviewed here said the Savings and Loan Holding Company Act makes it difficult for the agency to place restrictions on the unrelated activities of the holding company so long as only one S&L is being acquired.The FHLBB held a public hearing in January to assist it re-evaluating holding company laws.Many representatives of the financial industry have expressed concern about S&L acquisitions by outside investors.The proposed acquisition of United Financial Corp. by National Steel Corp. prompted Mr. McKinney to announce last month that S&L takeovers were ""a matter of concern"" and would be studied by a special agency task force.First Texas Financial is the nation's 11th largest S&L holding company, according to asset figures provided by Loeb Rhoades, Hornblower & Co.An FHLBB official said the activities of First Texas Financial are almost exclusively connected with its single S&L, which was formed in February as a consolidation of 10 associations.The agency official said that under a technicality in the S&L Holding Company Act, Beneficial would be considered a nondiversified company despite the fact that less than 10% of its consolidated earnings would come from First Texas Savings.The requirement that nondiversified holding companies receive approval for each debt offering would be removed for Beneficial in favor of the preapproval method, although annual projections of debt limits and quarterly reports of outstanding debt would be required. This was done primarily because the substantial activity of Beneficial in debt offerings which would make it difficult for the agency to regulate, it was explained.The altering of this requirement is based on a precedent set in 1976 when Household Finance Corp. received permission to acquire Keystone Savings and Loan Association, Anaheim, Calif., with preapproved debt servicing."
Banks Bar New Credits for Chrysler Corp.,The American Banker,"October 31, 1979, Wednesday","John F. McGillicuddy, chairman of Manufacturers Hanover Corp., said new credit commitments are ""not feasible"" at this time. ""I believe that Chrysler Corp. has substantially exhausted the possibilities for financing in the private sector,"" he said, voicing support for a government loan guarantee for the company.During more than two hours of testimony, Mr. McGillicuddy stressed that the banking community has provided substantial support to the auto manufacturer.He pointed first to the $4.5 billion of credit available to the company from banks throughout the world and then pointed more specifically to a $919 million revolving credit being arranged with 193 banks for Chrysler Financial Corp. as a sign of the support that Chrysler's banks continue to provide to the company and its subsidiaries despite Chrysler's well publicized financial difficulties.Despite splits in the group providing credit to Chrysler, ""the banking community has performed well,"" he said. ""The banking community has not run away from Chrysler Corp. or Chrysler Financial. We did what we said we were going to do. And I think we did it extraordinarily well.""Mr. McGillicuddy's testimony revealed that perhaps as many as 100 banks have bowed out of their relationships with Chrysler Financial and confirms that remaining banks have reduced their commitments by almost one-third, with the size of the total credit available to Chrysler Financial dropping from around $1.5 billion to about $1 billion.Following his testimony, Mr. McGillicuddy declined to state how many banks had originally been involved in the Chrysler Financial credit.He did point out, however, that some banks will continue to provide open lines of credit to Chrysler Financial, in addition to the revolving credit, which will bring the industry's total commitment to the finance company to about $1 billion.Mr. McGillicuddy also revealed in his testimony that the banking community has waived certain covenants in the revolving credit agreement with the parent company. That waiver expires Oct. 31. Letters were sent out Tuesday morning to the 102 banks in that credit asking them to extend the waiver for another month. Mr. McGillicuddy said he is confident that the banks will approve the extension of the waiver. Banking sources have said recently, however, that the waiver by the U.S. banks will depend on waivers by other long-term lenders. They said some doubt has been expressed about the willingness of some long-term lenders to Chrysler to extend the waivers.""We have provided substantial financial support to the company and will continue to provide support in the future,"" Mr. McGillicuddy told the subcommittee on economic stabilization of the House Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs Committee, pointing to the $4.5 billion in credit extending by U.S. and foreign banks. ""But there are areas where we cannot proceed any further,"" he said, one of which is in providing unsecured credit commitments.Mr. McGillicuddy reminded the subcommittee of the constituencies that banks have, including their shareholders, depositors and regulators. He noted, in response to a question, that banks might well be sued if they extend more credit to Chrysler, in the face of a decision by Federal bank examiners that loans to Chrysler are ""doubtful.""""We will endeavor to do what we can, where we can,"" he concluded, adding that banks ""have proceeded with great care, and will continue to proceed with care in the future.""While supporting the concept of loan guarantees, Mr. McGillicuddy said it is ""a judgment call"" as to whether an individual bank will agree to the terms of the Federal loan guarantees, and particularly whether creditors will be willing to subordinate their claims or Chrysler to the claims of the Federal government. ""It's a threshold question that all lenders will have to evaluate,"" he said.Mr. McGillicuddy and Tom Killefer, chairman of United States Trust Co. and a member of the board of Chrysler Corp., declined to suggest a specific figure for the size of the loan guarantee the government should consider. Both men referred to the amount suggested by Chrysler.Mr. McGillicuddy stated that banks feel a loan and a guarantee are virtually the same thing for a company in Chrysler's condition. He also suggested that the government could reduce its risk by extending credit of more than the minimum amount requested by Chrysler.The $750 million to $1.2 billion requested by Chrysler ""is just beyond the scope of the private sector,"" he stated. ""We're doing what we can do now. The banking industry has a rather full plate regarding Chrysler and affiliated companies.""Mr. McGillicuddy said that despite this commitment, he was not aware ""of Chrysler Corp. being a central part of any bank's situation. It's a problem, but it's not a make-or-break situation of any bank I know of."""
Your Friendly Neighborhood Banker Will Become the Grim Professional in the '80s,The American Banker,"October 16, 1979, Tuesday","With regard to the physical aspect of the bank, the epidemic of bank robberies in the era of friendliness is leading to a change in architecture that is likely to make the bank less friendly looking but more secure.The low counters and absent window grates have been a boon to burglars adept at vaulting the counter and grabbing the cash. The return to more protection, through the use of plastic shields and other barriers between the teller and the public is a natural response. And this, coupled with greater reliance on automatic teller machines may rob the bank of friendliness but will make it less vulnerable to robbery.A second area in which banks may become less friednly is in their provision of credit to the general public.We have lived through an era in which credit has become easier and easier to obtain. The result is that many Americans have serveral credit cards, each with a generous line of credit. Thus the percentage of after-tax income that must be dedicated to repaying installment debt has risen on average to a record of over 16%.Now, however, it appears bankers will be less anxious to advertise for new borrowers and less willing to extend so much credit to so many people. There are several reasons for this.First, many banks have pushed credit availability to a point at which people may be incapable of repaying their debts, especially in a recession such as we appear to be entering.Second, banks are finding it more difficult to obtain funds than to use them, so they will not be so anxious to place new credit card lines of credit on the books.Third, as is now obvious, the Federal Reserve intends to slash the rapid growth in availability of credit. And this in turn would make the banks less friendly in the (See NADLER on Page 5> eyes of these turned down for credit cards and credit lines.But the most immediate factor in the turn away from the image of friendliness is the changed pricing policy that most banks will have to undertake if they are to maintain profitability in the era of negotiable order to withdrawal accounts.Bankers have finally recognized that they can not be all things to all people. This means that service charges must be reimposed or raised, and that the era in which banks wanted to take on all customers, whether their accounts were profitable or not, is over.For many banks have decided that they can not continue having the 20% of profitable accounts subsidize the 80% that are marginal or unprofitable.This means that many institutions will have to raise fees to the point at which they alienate some customers.And while the bank bottom line will be better off without the losing accounts, there will be decided public relations flack when people start looking at banks as becoming ""exclusive"" again.The banks that have tried to get rid of small sized savings accounts and otherwise rationalize sloppy deposit structures have found frequently that community leaders react poorly, feeling that the bank is discriminating against poor people.This is a price that banks will have to pay for maintenance of profitability in the face of the cost of NOW accounts. And smart bankers have decided that forewarned is forearmed.Some have considered working with these community leaders to share the cost savings with the community and thus avoid and adverse publicity. Others have decided that they must explain their positions to the community in their advertising. And some have determined they have no choice but to brazen it out and take the necessary steps in pricing without public comment.But one point is clear: the days when bankers strove to be friendly appear to be ending. And what some observers indicate is that this is all to the good anyway. For even though bankers tried to give an image of friendliness, the public still did not believe them.Thus the bankers who stress professionalism, and accurate service over friendliness are more in tune with the public's idea of what a bank should be anyway."

Coping with change: What's a Thrift To Do?,The American Banker,"February 28, 1979, Wednesday","Our increasing propensity to spend rather than save is the result of a complex web of causes and effects that is beyond the scope of this article to attempt to unravel completely. However, two key threads stand out, and they are of paramount importance to the thrift industry because they relate directly to the value that consumers place on the sevices we offer.First, the public has come to believe that inflation is no longer a cyclical phenomenon but a permanent part of American life. Regardless of how high the price is today, it will always be higher tomorrow. Concomitantly, of course, money borrowed now will always be paid back in cheaper dollars later.Second, as consumers are accepting the fact that high inflation is a chronic condition, they are also realizing that not only are they failing to benefit from thrift, but that they are actually being penalized for putting their money in a typical savings account. People don't need any sophisticated mathematical models or high-priced tax lawyers to see that they're moving backwards when inflation is running at 9 or 10%, their money is yielding only 5 or 5 1/4%, and they're paying income tax at a 20 or 25% rate on earned interest as well.Thus, the institutionalization of inflation, and the resulting penalty for saving, have combined to produce a powerful new incentive for the consumer to succumb to the seductive appeal of Madison Avenue's omnipresent injunction to ""buy now, pay later.""In an attempt to cope with this phenomenon, the thrifts have pushed for legal authority to offer spending services that were previously the exclusive province of commercial banks and to offer savings vehicles tied to money-market rates. Checking accounts, NOW accounts, debit cards, and 26-week certificates are now all part of the vocabulary of the savings banker. And rumblings can be heard on the horizon about extending additional spending powers to the thrifts' depositors through credit cards and other consumer loans.This convergence with commercial banks on the deposit side has caused a growing schizophrenia among the thrifts on the loan side. Savings bankers are groping to discover their lending function --indeed their very raison d'etre -- in a new and rapidly changing environment.Historically, of course, thrifts were chartered for the purpose of making mortgages. If you take a look at the charter of any savings bank in this country, you will read a variation on the theme of ""accepting deposits from the community in order to return them to the community in the form of mortgage loans."" For many years, savings banks and the neighborhoods they served prospered through this investment in housing.Today, however, the thrifts find this role increasingly untenable. Disintermediation, high costs of funds, runaway inflation, mortgage-rate ceilings, deteriorating inner-city neighborhoods, tougher legislation, demanding community groups --the familiar litany of problems goes on and on. And the thrift industry is running scared. Savings bankers throw up their hands and decry the impossibility of borrowing short-term, high-cost dollars for investment in long-term, low-rate mortgages. At the same time, their minds turn to the greener investment pastures outside the mortgage market.However, savings bankers are kidding themselves if they think that getting out of the mortgage market is as simple as turning their collective backs on it and boning up on more sophisticated investment vehicles. It's not that easy anymore, because today the thrift industry is part of a larger socioeconomic drama.There are community groups and politicians who will allow us to flounder around looking for our new lending identity for just so long before they gladly assume the responsibility of allocating credit for us. Unfortunately, the community groups and the politicians are often more knowledgeable about new government regulations, bank lending practices, and local housing situations than are the bankers themselves. And government legislators and regulators are listening to these groups and taking action. The Community Reinvestment Act is only the beginning of an attempt to define the role of an industry that seems unable to define its own role.So what can the thrifts do? It seems to me that there are three alternatives. First is the option of doing nothing to confront a changing world. I should hasten to point out that this was the reaction of the dinosaur -- and thrifts will face the same Darwinian fate if we choose this alternative. Second is the option of mimicking the commercial banks, which leads to head-on competition with the giants of the financial industry -- with no interest rate differential to protect us and widespread public cynicism about our actions and confusion about our functions. This course of action may prolong the life of the thrift industry for a few years, but it is also likely to relegate us soon to the garbage can of history.The thrifts' third option is to reaffirm and extend their traditional role as makers of mortgages and builders of communities. Before you dismiss this alternative as economically naive and financially suicidal, stop for a minute and consider the following scenario:In my opinion, the thrift industry must adopt an active rather than a reactive position. We must stop resisting the enormous changes that are taking place in our cities --that is now a distinct possibility. It's no secret that rebuilding our cities is a monumental, multi-billion-dollar undertaking that is too large for the banking industry or, indeed, the public or private sector to tackle alone. What is needed is a coordinated approach among banks, corporations, community groups, local politicians, city and state officials, and the federal government -- and the savings bank industry should be leading this massive effort instead of bemoaning the difficulty of developing it. There is certainly no guarantee of success, but it seems to me that the thrifts must accept this challenge if we are to remain a vital force in America.Fine, you say, it sounds good in theory, but how do we make it work? I don't have all the answers, but I do want to point out four major advantages to an activist approach that many bankers have not given sufficient consideration.First, if the thrifts demonstrate a genuine, full-fledged commitment to spearheading the drive to revitalize our inner-city neighborhoods, we can expect cooperation instead of confrontation from local residents, politicians, and grassroots organizations. We can also look forward to a reversal of the current trend toward increasingly demanding ""watchdog"" legislation that is impinging on the banks' ability to chart their own course. Widespread public support for the thrifts will not materialize overnight, but it will begin to grow as we demonstrate our new approach.Second, most of our deteriorated innercity neighborhoods were once the best sections of town. Many buildings are now dilapidated, and they require rehabilitation -- ranging from facelifting to gutting. However, the majority of his housing stock is structurally sound, and it can be restored to its former glory. Once restored, many of these Victorian-era buildings are more attractive and desirable than modern-day ""cardboard"" houses.Third, an important new market is growing for this kind of housing, and the thrifts have failed to anticipate it. In recent years, young professionals are moving back to urban areas in increasing numbers. This new reverse imigration from the suburbs to the cities has been labeled ""gentrification"" by the sociologists, after the new ""gentry"" of young, upwardly mobile men and women who prefer the exciting diversity of the inner city to the somnolent sameness of suburbia. To this affluent group that is concerned with the ""quality of life,"" the sixth floor of an old warehouse that has been converted into lofts or a ""floor-through"" in a renovated brownstone is far more enticing than a sprawling ranch house or carbon-copy duplex in ""just-outside-of-town"" U.S.A.Fourth, there are a variety of new mortgage instruments that can be developed to serve the special needs of the young gentry and other target groups. The Variable Rate Mortgage (VRM) can help assure an adequate flow of mortgage funds, while making long-term loans viable once again for the thrifts. The Graduated Payment Mortgage (GPM) can help young professionals scale their mortgage payments to increasing incomes. The Reverse Annuity Mortgage (RAM) can help senior citizens tap the equity in their homes to avoid some of the hardships of living on a fixed income. These are just a few of the possibilities; resourceful savings bankers can surely develop others to serve emerging needs and populations.In conclusion, I believe that the thrifts' current identity crisis can best be resolved by reaffirming our traditional function as makers of mortgages, and up by updating this vital role to meet the challenges of a changing marketplace. We can no longer react defensively to a new world -- we must anticipate evolution and help to shape it. The question is not whether we can afford to pursue this course, but whether we can afford not to."
"BofNY Co. Acquiring Empire NB, Newburgh",The American Banker,"May 16, 1979, Wednesday","Deno Papageorge, vice president of Bank of New York, said he expects the acquisition to be complete in about nine months, assuming approval by the directors and stockholders of Empire, and Federal and state regulatory authorities, and negotiation of a definitive agreement.The shareholders of the $413 million-deposit Empire would receive $22 per share, a 39% premium compared with the book value at March 31 of $15.82.Mr. Papageorge said that the $7.4 billion-asset Bank of New York Co. ""has a good commitment to retail banking and we feel we can make money there."" Empire has 40 banking offices, primarily in Orange, Rockland and Dutchess counties.Last week Robert M. Kossick, president and chief executive officer of Empire, resigned to become CEO of the $796.5 million-deposit National Community Bank of New Jersey, Rutherford. Mr. Kossick said Tuesday that although he has ""a world of respect for Bank of New York,"" he would ""rather run my own organization.""Mr. Papageorge said that Mr. Kossick's decision was ""purely happenstance"" and that Mr. Kossick had been expected to continue to run the offices the Bank of New York Co. would acquire. ""He is a good manager,"" Mr. Papageorge said ""and would have been an asset to the Bank of New York."" He added, however, that the resignation had not affected the negotiations and that Bank of New York has ""good managers to put in there.""The Bank of New York, anchor of the Bank of New York Co., has 149 branches in New York, 140 of which are outside Manhattan, where it is based. It also has branches in London, Singapore and the Cayman Islands.The bank was founded in 1784 by Alexander Hamilton, the country's first Secretary of the Treasury. It was New York's first bank, is now the ninth largest in the state, and is the oldest bank in the country still operating under its original name.Credit to individuals represents about 23% of Bank of New York's $3.5 billion loan portfolio and consumer savings accounts are about 12% of the bank's $5.9 billion in deposits.Mr. Kossick, who had been at Empire National for 18 months, said last week that ""this was one of the most difficult decisions of my career"" but the National Community offer was ""something that couldn't be disregarded at this time.""Empire has had a spotty earnings record, marred by lawsuits and loan loss problems, and a bank spokesman said Mr. Kossick had been brought in to ""turn Empire around."" The spokesman added that the bank ""is now in much better shape.""Mr. Kossick said last week that he had been contacted by an executive search firm on behalf of National Community --international presence.""Neither bank would disclose the salary Mr. Kossick will be paid.William L. Staehle, former president of the New Jersey institution, died in February.Mr. Kossick, 38, went to Empire from the Bank of the Southwest, Houston, where he was executive vice president and member of the board. Bank of the Southwest is the anchor of Southwest Bancshares and the state's sixth largest bank. Mr. Kossick gained expertise in international banking during seven prior years with Citicorp, New York.Empire reported net income of eight cents per share in 1978, following five cents in 1977 and 90 cents in 1976. In 1975 the bank reported net income of four cents per share and in 1974, 81 cents.Reflecting the earnings problems, Empire did not pay a dividend in 1978, after cutting it to 12 cents per share in 1977 from 50 cents in 1976. In 1974 and 1975 the bank paid $1. Bank officers had told shareholders at this year's annual meeting that they hoped to reinstate the dividend by the 1979 fourth quarter, according to the bank spokesman.The bank received an unqualified opinion from its auditors in 1978, the first since 1972. The bank had been involved in several lawsuits related to Black Watch Farms. Three of the four Black Watch suits were settled by the end of 1978, ""ending the inordinate amount of management time and legal expense which had to be devoted to these problems,"" according to Mr. Kossick's letter to the shareholders in the 1978 annual report.National Community reported 1979 first quarter income before securities transactions of $2.363 million, or $1.16 per share, up from the year-earlier $2.549 million; or $1.12.A bank spokesman said the bank's international activities take the form of foreign collections, foreign exchange activity and letters of credit.He said the amount of international loans was not immediately available. The volume in the bank's international department doubled last year, according to the spokesman, who termed it ""a growing thing here."""
"MUTUAL SAVINGS BANKS Yearend Roll Call;
Inflation and Interest Rates Spur Innovation in Mortgage Lending",The American Banker,"January 31, 1979, Wednesday","Further growth and innovations in the market for mortgage-backed securities. Activity has been especially dramatic in conventional mortgage-backed passthrough obligations issued by private financial institutions. Such issues increased five-fold from only $225 million in 1977 to an estimated $1.2 billion in 1978. Along with GNMA-guaranteed issues, conventional mortgage-backed securities are helping to expand the overall supply of residential mortgage credit by attracting a significant proportion of funds from nonmortgage-oriented investors.further major innovations in this instrument, moreover, are in prospect. The Federal Home Loan Bank Board has recently approved sales of one to five year mortgage-backed bonds by member institutions. Until now, mortgagebacked bond issues have generally carried six to seven year terms. Also in process are efforts to expedite the issuance of mortgage-backed securities by small size institutions, through the marketing facilities of private mortgage insurance companies. Issues backed by variable rate and graduated payment mortgages are also being developed.Alternative mortgage instruments. The market for variable rate mortgages, including roll-over loans, has continued to broaden in those states permitting the use of such investments. Renewed interest in the use of graduated payment mortgages has also become evident recently. Government estimates now indicate that a total of 138,000 GPMs will be made in fiscal 1979, one-fifth above original projections. Prospects for broadening the entire AMI market were given an additional boost in late December when the FHLBB authorized Federal savings and loan associations to offer graduated payment and reverse annuity mortgages on a nationwide basis, and variable rate mortgages, in California. VRMs will be permitted in other states if they are needed to maintain competitive balance between state and Federally-chartered lenders.Municipal mortgage financing of single-family homes. This new, and highly controversial, type of residential financing technique had burst upon the mortgage market scene in only recent months. Its basic feature: the sale of tax-exempt bonds by municipalities for the purpose of providing home mortgage credit to ""middle income"" borrowers at below market interest rates. While only a few cities have implemented this program, many others are considering its use. This residential financing technique evidently appeals strongly to those communities seeking to reverse the exodus of middle-income families.Money market CDs. These Treasury bill-linked deposit instruments have exerted a significant short-run impact on mortgage market conditions since their creation in mid-1978. They are credited with helping to maintain the flow of mortgage funds in the 1978-79 period of escalating interest rates, although at the expense of record high interest rates to mortgage borrowers in many areas of the nation and intensified earnings pressures on thrift institutions. The implications of 6-month CDs for the mortgage market, moreover, extend far beyond their immediate effects. They signal a greater emphasis by the Federal Reserve on controlling credit in the various capital market sectors through ""price"" rather than availability. For mortgage markets, in particular, this may mean less severe cyclical fluctuations in activity than were experienced under the ""Regulation O"" determined swings of past years.Relaxation of usury ceilings. As mortgage costs have entered the double digit area, pressures to liberalize state restrictions on home mortgage interest rates have intensified. At present, 18 states have usury statutes which impose mortgage rate ceilings of 10% or less and, hence, seriously restrict the competitive yield position of residential mortgages in numerous local markets. Recently, however, significant relief from such unduly restrictive limitations have been enacted in New York and New Jersey, with similar measures reportedly under consideration in a number of other states.""In any event, the modernization process in mortgage markets is far from complete, and can be expected to continue, perhaps quite dramatically, in the decade ahead.""All of these developments -- and they are not a complete list -- have already significantly strengthened the structure of mortgage finance and hold great promise for the future. They will broaden the mortgage financing options available to both borrowers and lenders, expand the availability of mortgage funds, improve the flexibility and breadth of secondary mortgage markets and generally serve to integrate real estate finance into the nation's financial market structure.On a more fundamental level, however, these onrushing mortgage market developments also raise some basic questions. How significant will their impact be in the prospective economic and financial climate of the 1980s? Are there specific areas which remain in need of new approaches? How rapidly will these innovations, many of which are still in an early stage of development and in need of further refinement, be absorbed into the mortgage market? Let me cite a few brief observations on some basic requirements for realizing the full beneficial effects of recent mortgage market changes.Inflation must be brought under control. If the current inflationary spiral persists for a prolonged period, mounting interest costs on the money market CDs will intensify earnings pressures on mortgage lending thrift institutions to the point where many will de-emphasize or actually eliminate offerings. This would, of course, defeat the purpose for which the short-term instruments were created. Furthermore, the supply of residential mortgage credit from institutions continuing to offer the 6-month CDs can be expected to decline during a long period of severe inflation.An increased proportion of institutions would undoubtedly channel a large share of their investment funds into short-term investments for liquidity purposes. As for alternative mortgage instruments, surging housing prices and excessively high mortgage interest rates will simply price increased numbers of middle and lower income families out of the housing market, even with the availability of such newly developed instruments as GPMs and VRMs.Additional mortgage financing techniques should be developed to spur community revitalization. Much more needs to be done to stimulate the availability of mortgage credit for community revitalization programs. Especially critical is the need to encourage private leader participation in community investment programs through risk reducing mortgage financing arrangements. A number of co-insurance techniques have been developed in recent years which provide for private/public sharing of the considerable risks inherent in many community investment efforts. However, a much broader-based, comprehensive initiative will be required to reverse the long-run process of neighborhood decay plaguing so many of the nation's areas. In this regard, the National Association of Mutual Savings Banks has proposed the creation of a National Neighborhood Insuring Agency.NNIA would represent the conversion of FHA from a residential mortgage insuring agency to a federal entity empowered to insure the entire spectrum of residential and nonresidential investments necessary to revitalize neighborhoods and communities. Such an action would be a logical extension of one of FHA's original purposes -- the assumption of contingent liability for mortgage loans considered excessively risky for private fiduciary institutions.The NNIA approach would also help to stimulate the development of secondary mortgage markets in nonhousing community-related loans -- a major consideration in view of the fact that the neighborhood revitalization process should include supportive nonresidential facilities, as well as housing.Mortgage-lending institutions need to adjust rapidly. The dynamics of past and potential changes in the mortgage market structure will provide a considerable challenge to investing institutions. The rigid structural, regulatory and procedural barriers which left real estate finance in the backwater of financial market change shows every sign of continuing to crumble in the years ahead. As in recent years, mortgage investment policy decisions will be developed in a climate of proliferating mortgage instruments, expanding secondary markets and intensified pressures for new approaches to the problems of meeting the housing and related community needs of the nation.A high premium will clearly be placed on management ability to adjust effectively and swiftly to the increasingly complex investment options available in the mortgage sector.In sum, real estate financing has undergone far-reaching changes in an unusually short period of time. These changes, have yet to be fully understood, and will undoubtedly be refined further. In any event, the modernization process in mortgage markets is far from complete, and can be expected to continue, perhaps quite dramatically, in the decade ahead."
New Turkish Bank Laws Broaden Ownership Base,The American Banker,"November 1, 1979, Thursday","The new system does not carry any radical ideological differences. Nevertheless, it embodies some very substantial, practical innovations, especially with regard to ownership, credit policies and limits.The new system aims at broadening the base of ownership. A bank cannot be established with less than 100 shareholders. Individuals cannot hold more than 30% of the shares. To prevent family holdings, 30% includes shares held by fathers, mothers, spouses and children. Employee organizations such as unions and trusts are also limited in ownership and are allowed only 40% of the shares. Verification of ownership is insured by compulsory registry of all shares. To provide wider circulation, the new law limits the minimal nominal value of the shares to 10,000 Turkish liras.The intent of the law partakes of the populist atmosphere of our times which calls for wider ownership of all private enterprises. In practical terms, the new law in Turkey will involve two major and several smaller banks in which some of the most important industrial families have controlling interest. Ideological motivation underlies the new law. Turkey, like many of the developing countries, has many ideologically-biased bureaucrats, politicians, young academicians, and small businessman with prejudices against big business and great entrepreneurs which date from the history of the robber barons in the United States, even though the American experience does not apply to contemporary Turkey. Turkish industry has attained an advanced sophistication through the Kocs, the Sabancis, the Eczacibasis, the Sungurogulus, the Yasar's and other enterprising men. Unlike their earlier Western counterparts in earlier times, contemporary circumstances never allowed the Turkish entrepreneurs the freedom to act as they pleased. The state kept a very heavy hand of control on industrial development and the workers were always protected by the advanced social legislation. Yet the prevalent socio-economic philosophy in the country remians emotionally enticed with the ideas of the romantic reformers of the Nineteenth Century who looked upon the great captains of industry as robber barons. Much economic and financial legislation is tainted by these notions. For instance, those who inveigh against individual ownership of banks fail to take cognizance of the role family banking houses such as the Rothschild's, Harriman's, and Brockaus's play in investment banking in market societies.
Credit LimitsThe new law prescribes new rules and limits for bank credits with special emphasis on industrial loans. The credit limit for one person remains the same. It cannot exceed 10% of the capital and reserves of the bank. But for enterprises that fall within the Annual Development Plan, and for ventures directed to exports, an exception is allowed. In these cases the limit is 25% of the capital plus reserves. An additional exception of 30%-40% of capital and reserves is permitted for enterprises in the ""backward areas"" where the plan seeks to foster new ventures.The new system brings an advantage. The previous law mentioned simply the general areas of activity such as tourism, mining, and industry applicable to the 25% limit. This allowed for a wide range of interpretations which led to waste of scarce capital on enterprises superfluous to national interest. The present prescription ties the credits to the Development Plan of the country, directing them to national economic targets.The limits set by the previous law were often circumvented by forming affiliate companies to which additional credits would be extended. The banking system has received severe criticism from politicians and ideological opponents for heavy concentration of credits among few major holdings and industrial enterprises in the country. In many instances, the complaints rested on statistical justification. To avoid circumvention of the limits, the law has become very specific in the application of the limits:Credits extended to corporations of which a real person owns more than 10%, and to corporations of which he is board chairman, board member, general manager, assistant general manager, or manager are added to the credits extended directly to such real person;Credits extended to corporations in which a real person has unlimited liability are considered to be extended indirectly to such real person even if the real person has not received credit directly;Credits extended to corporations, 40% or more of which are owned by a real person or legal entity, are considered to be extended indirectly to such real person or legal entity even if the real person or legal entity has not received credit directly;Credits extended to corporations, 50% or more of which is owned by a real person or legal entity, and credits extended to other corporations in which these corporations separately or jointly are majority stock holders are considered to be extended to such real person or legal entity indirectly even if the real person or legal entity has not received credit directly.This will restrict to a considerable extent the credits to major corporations.The success scored in industrial development in Turkey demonstrates that in the outset of industrialization large concentrations of scarce capital resources in few hands prompted rapid growth which compensated for the inequality in the distribution of capital. Presently, Turkish industrial enterprises have become widely diversified. Large and small industries are spread across the country. A more equitable distribution of credits, which the new law is meant to effect, will undoubtedly inconvenience and retard the large enterprises but will not be altogether arrestive of industrial development.
Limits on Industrial ParticipationThe contribution of the Turkish banks to national development is multi-dimensional. They were the principal instruments in initiating and promoting savings habits. Savings accounts were rewarded by benefits which ranged from apartment flats, summer houses, and cars to tuition fees for schools. The promotional schemes became so pervasive as to lead every family or even every member of the family to open a savings account. The money in these accounts formed the capital which founded private industry in the country. The major banks such as the Yapi ve Kredi, Is Bank, Akbank, and Garanti Bank joined in the industrial build-up by founding new industrial ventures or by joining as partners. The banking law of 1958 encouraged these industrial participations. For instance, 25% ownership of an enterpise permitted unlimited credits. Many major enterprises came into being benefiting from this opportunity Much of the Turkish industry is undercapitalized. The financial draw-backs of this practice are obvious. Yet, in this instance, too, the overall benefits of starting new industries overcame the disadvantages of working on an 80%-90% base of credit.The new law places restrictions on the participation of the banks in industrial ventures. Bank participation in other enterprises, development and investment banks, and enterprises within the annual Five-Year Program are exempted from this limit. The bank must own 20% of the shares of an enterprise in order to qualify as a partner. Under the previous system, a bank could provide unlimited credit to enterprises in which it owned 25% of the shares. The new law abolishes the unlimited credit facilities to bank participations. Total credits to participations are restricted to 20% of the bank's capital and reserves. Again, an exception is made for enterprises within the annual development program in which the bank holds 20% ownership. The bank is permitted to extend to these participations credits of three times the bank's capital and resources, or 15% of the cash credit in its balance sheet of the previous year.The motivation behind these restrictions is again the same. The law is aiming at a more widespread distribution of credits. It is seeking to effect it by closing the options of the banks. The last 20 years have witnessed the proliferation of entrepreneurial skills in the country. For instance, the automotive industry receives many of its components from small support industries organized by small entrepreneurs. As the industrial complex expands and diversifies, the need for new support industries also grows. These enterprises need the promotion by bank credits. Even though the new law will impose restrictions on the participation of the banks in industrial development, resources thus spared will still be available to industry.
Foreign BanksArticle 8 of the new law authorizes the opening of foreign banks. The trade decree requires an application which the Ministries of Finance and Trade jointly approve and submit to the Council of Ministers for a ministerial decree.Once established, the foreign branch becomes subject to the same regulations that govern the domestic banks.Until now the Turkish market had been practically closed to foreign banks. Only those that were in Turkey at the time of the foundation of the Republic in 1923 such as the Ottoman Bank, Banco di Roma, Banca Commerciale Italiana, and Hollantse Bank Union remained operative. In the last 20 years the Bank of America and the Marine Midland Bank participated as junior partners in the founding of local banks. More recently, Libyan and Kuwaiti capital, in partnership with a couple of Turkish banks, established an Arab-Turkish bank.The recent advent of private banks into international development financing has had a salutory effect in the concept of banking in Turkey. First of all, it brought Turkey into the limelight of international banking. No matter how we may deplore Turkey's present financial insolubility, the fact that within three years she did generate some $5 billion of credits testifies to the basic soundness of her socio-economic set-up. Even though the spread was provocative, the lenders that compromise the largest and most sophisticated banks in the world would not have taken the bait if basic economic factors did not justify the risk. The misfortune lay in political mismanagement which came about at a most critical time, when a consolidation of Turkey's international finances was due. Change in government resulted in the loss of two crucial years in the implementation of corrective measures. The recent IMF agreement has revived the interest of international banking in Turkey. The re-scheduling and the new loans will continue to keep Turkey in the international financial community. The convertible Turkey lira deposits are, indeed, an unfortunate episode in Turkey's relations with the international banking world. Turkey's first advance into the international financial markets deserved a more auspicious initial venture. Nevertheless, the misadventure also has a benign by-product. It has fostered a closer relationship between Turkey and the international financial community. So much so that several American, British and German banks have opened up representative offices in Turkey, a token of a continued interest in the Turkish market. The closer contacts that these representatives will foster is bound to inspire a more constructive and cooperative attitude towards the presence of foreign banks in Turkey. The authorization provided by the new law for the opening of new banks will not take long to be utilized.Since the phenomenon is universal, we cannot grudge Turkey's disfavour of foreign banks. Not only the government sector, but the private banks as well, were adverse to the foreign presence. They feared the competition rightly, expecting the foreign banks to use their larger resources to provide more extensive credits and facilities to Turkish customers. But today, Turkish banking has become so well established, and its interest so intertwined with that of its customers, that no enticement can dislodge it from its present stance in the market. The additional capital that the foreign banks can bring, and the additional facilities they can provide abroad for the development of Turkish exports would be such as to outweigh the competitive advantages to the local banks.The convertible Turkish lira deposits have also had a beneficial effect in awakening the consciousness of Turkish banks to the opportunities in their international relations. Until recently, banking development had remained strictly confined to the domestic field. In their international relations, the banks were confined to technical banking exchanges such as letters of credit, processing exports, imports and similar transactions. In consequence, the relations between Turkish banks and their international counterparts remained limited, restricted to exchanges between the technical personnel directly involved. There was no dialogue on the policy and the management level which applied even to the central bank. The Turkish financial community had remained out of rapport from the decision-making level of international banking.The last five years are spotted with several efforts by Turkish banks to expand contacts with the international banking community. Managers of the major banks have to travel abroad to initiate personal contacts with their international correspondents. Several banks have opened representative offices in London, Zurich, Frankfurt and New York. The Yapi ve Kredi Bank has organized a new department for developing international relations.These efforts reveal a healthy response to the international challenges to Turkish banking. Indeed, in the short time they have been applied, they have brought tangible improvement in the relations of the Turkish banks with the international banking community. For instance, even though credit to Turkey has been under deep-freeze for the last 18 months, the enhanced relationship with the international banks has generated several million dollars worth of acceptance credits, providing Turkish industry with its most indispensable needs. Nevertheless, this application to a closer, more intense, more systematic relationship with the internationl community still remains only an instinctive reflex to practical necessity. The top management is still fully wedded to domestic banking.Boards composed of businessmen, industrialists, and bankers encumbered with innumerous domestic banking problems naturally tend to look upon international relations as a necessary evil. The representatives abroad, in many cases technicians in international transactions, by force of habit and practice, confine their relations to their technical counterparts. The dialogue that Turkey so urgently needs in the decision-making level of the international financial community proceeds at a turtle's pace, which Turkey cannot afford.As verified by the World Bank's report on Turkey, her potential is adequate to meet the requirements on new credit. Having made headlines with her financial woes for almost two years, she urgently needs an intimate dialogue with the international financial community to ascertain her creditworthiness. This is a critical task to which Turkey must address herself nationally. In the present political embroglio, it is foolhardy to expect the public sector to pursue the task effectively. The burden falls on the private banks. Fortunately, in these most difficult months, they were able to preserve their credibility in the international community which could add effectiveness to their efforts. The application to such a task demands a new understanding from the governing boards about the place of international relations in the hierarchy of the bank. Men versed in international finance, experienced in international economics, and practiced in international negotiation must sit on the boards to introduce these new international dimensions. International representatives must have the background and experience that would enable them to converse on equal terms with top bankers all over the world. Politicians and bureaucrats must recognize the crucial role of the private banks in Turkey's international finance. They must support and encourage it.I came into banking because of many years of experience in international economics and finance. My work with the United Nations Development Program, the Economic and Social Council and various other United Nations organizations had provided many contacts with the world banking community and had yielded some know-how in financial negotiation. I joined the Yapi ve Kredi Bank with the conviction that my experience would be of value in initiating a new level of international dialogue for the Turkish banking community. The years have not belied my conviction. Furthermore, I have observed a healthy, steady escalation in the esteem of the Turkish banks' international relations. For this reason, I feel confident that Turkish banks will play their role in establishing Turkey's international creditworthiness as effectively as they did in promoting and supporting Turkey's economic development.Picture, NURI EREN"
The Bogeyman of Bigness,The American Banker,"July 16, 1979, Monday","Ms. Siebert's point about ""domination"" evokes the usual image of whales swallowing minnows -- an image that is calculated to elicit an appropriately negative response from the public and the small banking community. But what does ""domination"" really mean? Judging by the statistics cited elsewhere in Ms. Siebert's report, Marine Midland is at present a pretty dominant force in many upstate markets -- much more dominant than is, say, Citibank in New York City. For example, Marine Midland's share of commercial bank deposits totals 63% in Buffalo and 57% in Elmira. Now, suppose a couple of New York City banks bought some local institutions in these communities and, by aggressive advertising and promotion, managed to reduce Marine Midland's share of deposits. Would that be good or bad for the citizens of Buffalo and Elmira? Most banking scholars would argue that it would be good. By reducing the concentration of deposits in a given primary service area, such a step might improve bank services and lower loan yields, which is precisely what happened when the New York City banks entered Nassau County in the early '60s.All of this is, of course, a bit fanciful. As Ms. Siebert's report implies, most New York City banks have not been especially happy with the performance of their existing upstate branches. If, however, they were disposed to mount a campaign to acquire upstate banks or holding companies, it is hard to see how that would damage the interests of the people of New York State.In citing the threat of domination, Ms. Siebert may be mixing up two quite distinct concepts of economic concentration: aggregate and market. Aggregate concentration focuses on the ratio of the deposits of the largest banks to those of the universe of banks in the state. Market concentration, on the other hand, refers to the percentage of deposits accounted for by the leading banks in a particular primary service area. The two concepts are logically separate. Aggregate concentration can be increasing while market concentration is decreasing.Take a reductio-ad-absurdam situation. Suppose the 10 top banks in New York City bought out every bank in the state, and the pattern of expansion was such that all 10 banks became equally represented in every primary service area. Aggregate concentration would rise since the 10 would now control all the deposits in the state. But market concentration would probably fall since none of the 10 would have more than 10% of the deposits in any given upstate community.Now, which concept of concentration is the more relevant one? Obviously, if one is talking about the consumer and small businessman --concept is that of market concentration. The Buffalo consumer would probably be much better off dealing with 10 banks -- each of which had an equal share of the market -- than he is dealing with a banking community so obviously dominated by Marine Midland.To be sure, if aggregate concentration rose appreciably, banks might have more political clout. But in the last decade or so, the relative power of banks and business in general has weakened, while that of the young, the aged and the poor has risen. It is therefore doubtful whether a potential increase in aggregate concentration would have any great effect on the political future of New York State. Given these facts, it is hard to see what is bothering Ms. Siebert, unless the comment about domination was inserted purely for its emotive effect."
Bankers Urged to Hold Down Rates,The American Banker,"October 26, 1979, Friday","Mr. McEnteer plans to write to state chartered banks asking them to base rates on their actual cost of funds.Although large city banks, or money center banks, have to pay high rates for funds, many smaller banks get the bulk of their funds from their depositor's savings and checking accounts at lower and more stable rates, Mr. McEnteer pointed.""Hopefully,"" he commented, ""community banks will not find it necessary to raise interest rates beyond the reach of their customers.""Mr. McEnteer said he feels that Regulation Q should be phased out over a period of time, with ceiling rates raised 1/4% to 1/2% over a five to ten year period before being dropped completely. Such a time span, he suggested, will be necessary because of the number of long-term mortgages written in the past at low interest rates. These mortgages, he said, could be paid off over a period of time in which interest rates on savings are allowed to rise gradually.Legislative action to eliminate usury ceilings is necessary, he said, but the state legislature has hesitated to change the state's usury rates.Mr. McEnteer also reported that he is working with pro and con factions within the state banking industry with regard to the abolition of Pennsylvania's prohibition on statewide banking. Presently, a bank may branch only into counties continguous with the county in which its official headquarters is located. Legislative action is required to make such a change, according to Mr. McEnteer, but submission of a bill to the state legislature is practical only when some agreement between the parties is reached.Mr. McEnteer described the current national economic sceneas this country's ""greatest economic challenge since the 1930s.""He said the Federal Reserve's effort to reduce inflation by increasing rates and requiring reserves on certain types of liabilities ""may hurt individual borrowers, but hopefully it will be worth it if inflation is stopped."""
Pa. Mutual Branch Bid Under Fire,The American Banker,"September 11, 1979, Tuesday","Sam Sue, an organizer for the group, accused the mutual savings bank of ""exporting"" funds from the city to the suburbs.Samuel Evans 3d, president of the mutual, objected to the charge, which was based on a report prepared by David W. Bartlet of the Urban Institute of Temple University. It was prepared for the Institute of Civic Values, a frequent critic of banks and other mortgage lenders.Mr. Bartlet said that whereas Girard Bank put 82% of its 1977 residential loans in Philadelphia, Germantown Savings placed 28% of its mortgages in the city.Mr. Evans said, however, that Girard's mortgage investment in the city was only $2.9 million while Germantown's investment was more than $7.3 million.William H. Ewing, an attorney and chairman of the PCNO's subcommittee on redlining and reinvestment, said that a bank or savings and loan association should ""not necessarily"" be forced to keep all of its locally generated deposits in the neighborhood.He suggested, however, 50% as a fair level ""to repair the damage that has been done in the past.""Mr. Ewing charged that Germantown Savings ""was not putting enough money in mortgages in the city, and particularly in the census tracts that are composed predominately of people who are minorities.""He said that this applied to 15 census tracts in Germantown and East Germantown.Mr. Evans said, ""we maintain three offices in Germantown and East Germantown. That certainly doesn't sound as if we are ducking the area.""Mr. Ewing acknowledged that Germantown Savings was one of the originators of the Philadelphia Mortgage plan, a citywide effort of mortgage lenders to pump mortgage money into declining neighborhoods, and he called the plan ""helpful.""But Joseph Markano, a PCNO organizer, said the group wanted to exert ""community pressure"" on the bank because, he charged, it ""is not living up to the spirit"" of the Community Reinvestment Act."
NYC Antiredlining Coalition Assails Bank CRA Statements,The American Banker,"June 5, 1979, Tuesday","In a report focusing on the CRA statements of 15 savings and commercial banks, the coalition said banks are continuing to invest the vast majority of their assets outside New York State though they claim many New York City neighborhoods as their primary service area.""The CRA statements are so broad in scope, unclear in concept and vague in intent that they are virtually meaningless,"" CAR said in its report. It maintained that banks must be held accountable for producing ""a meaningful, forthright, and honest CRA statement.""Further, CAR recommended that criteria be established compelling banks to address the needs of their home communities before they are permitted to expand their real-estate investments outside the state.The CAR report said that the $892 million-deposit East New York Savings Bank, Brooklyn, has attempted to transfer a viable branch in Brownsville, a largely black area of Brooklyn, to Bay Ridge, a largely white section of Brooklyn. The move would leave Brownsville depositors with no banking services, it said, and antiredlining groups are opposing the transfer.Paul B. Murray, president of East New York, confirmed in an interview Monday that an application to transfer the branch had been submitted to the state Banking Department. He disputed, however, a CAR statement that East New York had refused to meet with concerned community groups. Mr. Murray pointed out that East New York officers on May 25 had met with representatives of Bank on Brooklyn, an antiredlining organization.The meeting was confirmed by Juliet Tompkins, a Bank on Brooklyn spokeswoman.Commenting on the CRA statement of the $521.8 million-deposit North Side Savings Bank, the Bronx, CAR said the savings bank does not offer mortgages on multifamily buildings, which it said constituted 80%-90% of the housing stock in Bronx County.It added that last April, North Side advertised for two weeks in different media that mortgage money was available. CAR said, ""A week and a half after this media blitz, the North Side took itself out of the mortgage market!""A spokesman for North Side asserted Monday that the savings bank currently does offer real-estate service to multifamily dwellings. He went on to say that during the advertising campaign mortgage money was available and that the advertising was discontinued before North Side had stopped offering mortgages.Discussing the CRA statement of the $43.4 billion-deposit Chase Manhattan Bank NA, New York, CAR said that in 1977 Chase invested only $11,085,000 in multifamily dwellings in New York City while it invested $89 million for multifamily dwellings in Puerto Rico. It said Chase's CRA statement does not even mention Puerto Rico as a service area.CAR rejected what it termed ""bankers' chronic complaints"" that they do not make more mortgage loans because rent-controlled apartment buildings are uneconomic, because of the high cost of money and because of a high risk factor in New York City.CAR said only about one-third of New York City tenants currently live under rent control. Owners historically have financed major repairs through refinancing of longstanding mortgages and not from rent rolls, it said.""Many neighborhoods with a preponderance of rent-controlled apartments are stable and healthy when mortgage financing is made available,"" CAR added. It cited as examples Borough Park and Bensonhurst in Brooklyn.Replying to a statement that banks are borrowing funds at 11.5%, CAR said that most funds lent by savings banks and savings and loan associations are obtained from banks' savings deposits, for which they pay consumers less than 6%. The average cost to banks of all savings accounts is slightly more than 6%, it said, while the current ceiling for residential mortgages is 9.75%.Discussing the risk factor in making mortgages, CAR suggested that prejudices sometimes are involved in bankers' decisions. ""Lenders rarely discuss their subjective perceptions of the impact of racial change on property values directly,"" it said.CAR said most CRA statements ""appeared to be either throwaway compliance for a bothersome law or public relations platforms."""
Monroe Savings Expands Rehab Area,The American Banker,"October 12, 1979, Friday","In expanding the program, the bank allocated an additional $500,000 in mortgage funds bringing the total commitment to $1.5 million.The Urban Mortgage/Rehab Program is a unique one which enables participants to finance both the purchase and renovation cost with one long-term mortgage loan. The program was first introduced by Monroe Savings Bank in July with a commitment of $1 million in mortgage funds to be used in the areas serviced by the 19th Ward Community Association and Northeast Area Development, Inc.Monroe Savings Bank has been actively involved with the NHS organization since its inception. Michael Lebowitz, NHS Executive Director, said he is ""pleased that Monroe Savings Bank has expanded their Urban/Rehab Program to include the area serviced by the NHS. The purpose of NHS is to reverse housing and neighborhood deterioration to a level of stability and appreciation in the Edgerton-Brown Square neighborhood. These funds designed to encourage the purchase and rehabilitation of homes in this area will assist us in our efforts to continue the revitilization currently underway in this area.""The Urban Mortgage/Rehab Program was developed by Monroe Savings Bank with the active assistance of the Community Development Department of the City of Rochester and the neighborhood associations involved. The program is unique in the Rochester area and in this part of New York State in that it provides long-term financing for existing homes that require significant rehabilitation prior to occupancy.Normally a home purchase and rehabilitation of this type must be financed by a mortgage loan and one or more home improvement loans with a shorter term, which results in substantially higher monthly payments. The effect of combining both the purchase price and the rehabilitation costs into one long-term mortgage loan is to put home ownership within the reach of many more Rochester families. At the same time, the program helps to make the recycling of older homes in Rochester economically feasible."
"Respondent Banks Increasingly Cite Need for Educational, Training Services",The American Banker,"December 7, 1979, Friday","It long has been the practice of regional correspondent banks, including United Bank of Denver, to conduct annual one- or two-day conferences for their customer banks. This practice continues at our bank in the form of a one-day Correspondent Bank Management Conference, designed to address the needs of executive officers on a variety of topics, such as the economic environment, asset/liability management, marketing, regulation and compliance, legislation, and personnel management.More specific respondent needs on these topics are addressed by individual correspondent bankers who draw on their own experiences and also utilize the expertise of staff areas throughout the bank. The nature of the response varies from a simple answer to an extended visit to our bank, supported by a detailed agenda that may require several days to complete.Both of these practices continue to be important in serving the needs of our customers; however, in recent years, we have found it necessary to introduce formal in-house workshops and traveling mini-seminars to cope with the more universal needs to these banks.Since 1972, we have been conducting two-day seminars on personal banking. These seminars have been attended by banks from all over the world with typically 50 bankers in attendance. Positive feedback from respondents to this effort plus a growing demand for trained lenders throughout the region resulted in our establishing an in-housing loan analysis workshop in 1975.After experimentation with content, format, duration, and class size in 1975 and 1976, we concluded that a two-week program with approximately 12 students was most appropriate for our community bank participants.Using this format, seminars have been conducted since 1977 with three held so far in 1979.This program is designed for loan analysis and junior loan officers with one to three years of experience. During the course of the workshop, participants receive an accounting review and a thorough review of basic financial analysis techniques as they apply to typical commercial loan requests from retailers, wholesalers and manufacturers. These reviews are supported through practice of these techniques in case study situations and by overviews of banking practices presented by the managers of our various industry lending groups.In addition to this on-going program, an energy lending seminar was conducted in 1978, and workshops for lenders on the Uniform Commercial Code and bankruptcy laws have been held this year.To deal with the needs of a geographically dispersed group of community banks and to respond in a timely manner to current banking issues, we instituted traveling mini-seminars this year. These seminars primarily have focused on compliance issues and the pricing of consumer banking services. The current rate of change in bank regulation suggests that compliance will be a continuing topic, and this format has proven to be effective in satisfying the needs of our customers.As a correspondent bank, we also enthusiastically support and participate in the educational efforts of professional organizations such as American Institute of Banking, Bank Administration Institute, Robert Morris Associates and state and national banking associations.The general trend in banking points to a need for more education that is more specific in content than has been the case.

"Banks' Plans, Like Airlines', Should Gear Services To Specific Market Segments",The American Banker,"December 26, 1979, Wednesday","""The principals are the same. It is a tremendous amount of government regulation and paperwork that makes the difference,"" is a frequent reply.With this in mind, it was fascinating to sit in recently on a meeting at which the management of a major airline explained to its field people how they planned pricing and service in the new era of airline deregulation. The ideas developed and presented offer many good suggestions to bankers as well, as they also prepare for a period of far greater competition and freedom in pricing and service selection than we have seen in the past.One airline problem is that with a limited number of planes, airport facilities, and people, and with ever more expensive fuel, a line cannot be all things to all people. Airline deregulation gives the lines the opportunity to look at the map of the U.S. and serve any city pairs they want to. But with the number of possible city pairs ranging into the thousands and facilities limited, the choice of the best routes is the key.What this one airline did is to plot all the cities it served both from a standpoint of potential traffic generation and its own strength in each community relative to that of other airlines. (It is fascinating how people in some cities will stick to one airline while elsewhere another will be the odds-on favorite.)Where a combination of traffic potential and airline strength was greatest, this is where service would be stressed. Where it was felt that this airline would do poorly because of low traffic potential or superior image of a competitor, service was downgraded or dropped.Finally, if a territory offered huge potential and the airline was not presently in it, it would start service to that community from its own areas of strength under the new freedom of competition airlines have received.Banks have the same opportunity of picking and choosing between services and not being all things to all people. And the banks that are spinning off branches, selling subsidiaries, or concentrating on certain markets and downgrading others are utilizing the same principals.The airline industry is looking next at cost as a major factor in determining even which areas with great potential for traffic should still be abandon or downgraded. For with fuel as expensive as it is, certain routes are just not profitable under any circumstances. One airline announced recently that it was giving up its route from Newark to London because even with 100% of the seats filled in both directions, it would still lose money flying Boeing 707s with todays cost of fuel.Basically, the short-haul routes are unprofitable to major carriers, and more and more of them are turning these routes over to feeder lines whose cost of operation are lower, and concentrating on trunks for longer segments.Similarly, banks and thrifts are finding that if a service is unprofitable, why offer it? For example, many thrifts that have had powers to offer checking accounts feel pretty happy that they have not stressed this new highly expensive service, or not offered it at all. This also helps explain the interest of some banks in concentrating on the higher income market and neglecting the smaller deposit account and borrower.Finally, the airlines have found through deregulation that prices of competitors need not be identical. People have stayed loyal to an airline whose price is well above that of a competitor for the same trip. For example, for a Chicago-to-Seattle flight, one carrier today charges $258 and another $295 for a one-way first class ticket. Yet the cheaper carrier is not gaining market on the more expensive one.In some cases, where one carrier feels it has an advantage, either because of better public image, more convenient facilities for change of planes, or nonstop service, it is willing to charge more for this, and the public apparently is willing to pay for it.We have also seen that where ability to pay is stronger, airlines have charged more and gotten it. As example, a flight from New York to West Palm Beach, Florida, a highly affluent community, costs $18 more first class than a New York-to-Miami flight, almost 100 miles further, but serving a much more varied community in terms of wealth.Here again is a lesson for banks, for they cannot be all things to all people. And the institutions that have changed pricing and service orientation to beef up profits have been as happy as the airlines have been with such changes.For in banking as in airlines, a modest segment of the market generates the major profits and a small segment generates the greates losses. It is the job of executives in both these industries to recognize this fact and tailor services and prices to take advantage of sharp disparities in profit potential."
Dance-a-Thon Called ATM Booster,The American Banker,"July 10, 1979, Tuesday","The bank staged the ""dance-a-thon,"" involving some 100 highschool students trying to raise money for an education trip, with a ""Banc-a-Thon"" to demonstrate its new machine, drawing approximately 4,000 to 5,000 persons to the facility, and giving demonstrations of it to 1,388.By May, according to the bank, it had already exceeded its six month new accounts goal with an increase of 57% over its first machine, and a four-month increase of 91.7% usage over the original machine.The new installation, in a circular, glass-walled structured at the bank's Santa Clara office, was heavily advertised locally, even to using bumper stickers and T-shirts.But the grand opening in January was held in conjunction with a group of students who were members of a group called ""Close-Up,"" and who are trying to raise money for an educational trip to Washington.The students were offered $100 for each hour during which a specified number of ATM demonstrations, and were given tickets for the demonstrations to be distributed by them throughout the community. The event ran from 7 p.m. on a Friday until 7 p.m. the following day.The event not only enabled the bank to give the 1,388 demonstrations and at least bring a few thousand others into contact with the facility, but enabled the students to raise their money for the trip.""Unquestionably,"" said Leon W. King, vice president, marketing, our efforts on behalf of the 'Close-Up' group enhanced our reputation as a concerned member of the community. That effect is, of course, not as measurable as our new account gain, but to us it is of equal importance.""The bank, using Diebold TABS machines, plans to install two more of them at additional offices."
BofA to Nearly Double its Charitable Aid To Help Solve Problems Caused by Prop. 13,The American Banker,"February 5, 1979, Monday","In the same news release announcement, however, the bank took pains to emphasize that its increase of at least $10 million in charitable contributions does not represent a decision to pass along its property tax savings from Proposition 13, a gesture that has been demanded generally of California corporations by consumer activists and others.The $71.4 billion-deposit Bank of America had publicly stated that it felt its $3.6 million in 1978 tax savings could best help Californians by being used to increase lendable funds.Although this position is shared by several other banks, two major rivals last month announced one-time-only charitable donations of their Proposition 13 tax savings. Early in the month, the $13.7 billion-deposit Wells Fargo Bank NA here announced community grants totaling $1.2 million. Late last year the $9.7 billion-deposit United California Bank, Los Angeles, announced special corporate charitable gifts totaling $1 million, and a spokesman for the bank later confirmed that this represented its property tax savings for 1978.In its announcement last week, BofA vice chairman Arthur V. Toupin said the bank's charitable contributions would be increased to $22 million over the three-year period.He said, however, that the increased level of giving has been made possible by the strong earnings performance of the bank and ""not because of any tax savings that may be realized under Proposition 13.""""Proposition 13 is a tax-relief measure for both individuals and businesses,"" Mr. Toupin stated. ""In passing the measure, voters sent a message that the size of government should be contained and that business organizations will be expected to provide a greater share of the investment needed to promote economic growth and jobs in the state.""In light of these factors, he continued, ""it's clear that the most productive and proper way for Bank of America to employ any actual tax savings"" is to keep them in the mainstream of our banking operations.""This we will do,"" Mr. Toupin declared. ""Nonetheless, we're deeply concerned that dislocations arising from Proposition 13 will be increasingly felt in California communities over the next three years.""These fears, he said, included the belief that more government workers will lose their jobs and that there will be disclocations in school systems, urban neighborhoods, human service agencies, art and cultural organizations and job training programs.""For these reasons,"" he explained, ""a significant portion of the bank's increase in contributions is expected to be used in helping to solve community problems caused by Proposition 13 reductions. A bank task force is working to identify the greatest of these needs and to develop a plan to help meet them.""He said that target areas where increased contributions are likely to provide the most effective results include education and job training, the problems of people in declining urban neighborhoods, human-service agencies such as those serviced by United Way, and private efforts to assist local governments in providing public services more efficiently.Asked about the announcement, a bank spokesman denied that BofA had received complaints about its position that Proposition 13 tax savings should be used to increase lendable funds, although it had received ""some inquiries"" following Wells Fargo's press conference.The bank spokesman also pointed out that BofA had earlier announced a program of its own to help deal with the expected effects of Proposition 13, including helping public employees displaced by the measure to find employment with the bank.He said that the bank had received 125 inquiries and had hired 20 persons through that program, and suggested that the low number was the result of relatively few public-employee layoffs having been made so far. The impact of the proposition on local government was softened last year as the result of massive aid by the state government."
A Small Grace Note for America,The American Banker,"July 19, 1979, Thursday","While these news items may provide some fun and occasionally result in legislation, they obscure the fact that in towns across the United States the small-town bank has an interested and functional role in the community it serves.Often that role is cultural, providing continuity with a town's past, its events and its people. By simply being in business for over 100 years, or being as old as the town itself, a bank can convey a sense of belonging not associated with other types of business enterprises.Often (but not often enough) the role is economic, providing stimulus for money and ideas, beneficial to the community.The role has also been one of compassion, working closely with people who are going through periods of trouble, some of which is self-inflicted, others the sort of tragedy which can happen to any of us.Certainly there is the social aspect of providing a center where people see each other and exchange views, even as they transact their routine business.Finally, the bank is a haven, an instrument of security for those who wish to house and safeguard different types of assets.The above functions are not inconsistent with business goals of earnings, dividends, growth. A small-town bank's profit is often predicated on its ability to fulfill these varied functions, consistent with the tempo, fabric and needs of the community served.While a small-town bank must focus on the happenings of its own particular marketplace, it must also be sensitive to national and (progressively) international trends which will also affect that marketplace. Issues of foreign inward investment, mergers and acquisitions, regulatory and legislative changes, inflation and monetary policies are no longer the private domain of citizens residing in large urban centers. People in small towns cannot live unmindful of these events any more than the banks operating in these towns.Because a bank operates in a small town it does not mean that the bank can afford to operate as it did in the early 1900s. Technology, particularly communication technology, has given small-town banks exceedingly long grasps. It has also eliminated the ""fortress"" which isolated small towns from the less sensible strains of national madness.Small banks in small towns therefore increasingly require the same sophisticated management resources with which to operate as their big-city brethren. This fact is not understood by the big-city correspondent, the industry regulators or the politicians.Laws and regulations are promulgated either ignoring totally the impact on small banks or providing a special exemption for banks under a certain size. Both approaches are patronizing. Both approaches are wrong. One creates big-bank regulation which swamps the small bank in a backwash of industry ignorance. The other, blatantly political, perpetuates the myth that big banks and big government know what is best for small banks.Pressures are created at state levels calling for ""parity,"" ""equality,"" ""efficiency"" -- words designed to finally destroy the small-town bank through statewide mergers or acquisitions. It remains to be seen whether small-town independent banks can maintain their traditional independence and continue to succeed. While their success might not be necessary for the future of our country, the existence of a strong network of independent small-town banks can nevertheless contribute a small grace note to the mercantile landscape of America."

New York,The American Banker,"May 7, 1979, Monday","FLUSHING SAVINGS BANK, New York: The bank has purchased $500,000 in New York City Industrial Development Agency bonds which will enabled H&D Automatic Transmission Service Inc. to establish a $1.3 million manufacturing plant in College Point, Queens. Mayor Koch and other city officials attended ceremonies this month opening the new facility, which was formerly an incinerator owned by the New York City. The site is in College Point Industrial Park, on Whitestone Expressway near 31st Avenue. George C. Brynes, president and chief executive officer of Flushing Savings Bank, said that savings banks in New York City agreed in October, 1977, to promote the purchase of up to $50 million in IDA bonds to encourage industrial operations to remain in or to locate in the city of New York. Such purchases of IDA bonds would be made as part of individual bank portfolios, rather than as part of a formal pool arrangement. The legislation that created IDA endowed it with real estate tax relief for companies which it is financing. This financing often is accomplished at a lower interest rate than is available through conventional sources because of income tax exemptions available for the bonds. In addition to Flushing Savings Bank's $500,000, H&D, producer of automatic transmissions and related products, is putting up $150,000 itself.CHEMICAL BANK, New York: The bank recently co-sponsored a block-by-block clean up campaign, ""Manhattan -- its Time to Clean Up Our Act."" The project was organized by the Office of the Manhattan Borough President. Community participation extended from Manhattan's northern tip to Battery Park, involving over 150 block organizations and community, tenant and merchant groups. Groups competed in the Most Improved Block Contest which awarded 12 prizes of $100 each. The prize money will be used for block improvements. Chemical Bank donated heavy-duty garbage bags used in the program throughout the borough."
"Location, Location and Location",The American Banker,"January 5, 1979, Friday","A project that has everything else going for it in the way of architecture, quality, and surrounding esthetics often fails to attract buyers or tenants because of a poor location.Conversely, properties that look unattractive have found buyers and renters who have built them into something of value, because the location was good. They were willing to make the investment or accept lower quality housing because the location made up for other disadvantages.Bankers recognize this as they make loans on real estate. Often they find a home or multifamily dwelling that had good fundamentals, good surrounding infrastructure, and everything else solid turn into a loss situation because of the decay of the surrounding community. And if one point is clear, it is that no individual structure can remain valuable when the surroundings deteriorate.But bankers have difficulty, just as every other group, in determining which areas are going to be favorable locations in the years ahead and which are going to deteriorate.There are no totally reliable rules here. Only intuition and foresight. Yet bankers must gamble on developments that will take place years in the future.How could anyone have predicted shortly after World War Two, when the suburbs were being built quickly and in many instances tackily, that the suburbs would become not only the center for the residences of most affluent people in most cities, but that also they would become the center of much industry and commerce?How could people have predicted that many conventions would desert the downtown hotels for the suburban facilities? Or the hotels located so close to the airports that many conventioneers never found out that certain cities had any more to them than an airport, a shuttle bus, and a close-by full service hotel? For at that facility entertainment, lodging, food, and outside recreation all were concentrated, albeit under the continuing drone of the planes landing only a mile or two away.Similarly, who could have predicted the trend of the late 1970s back to restoration of downtown America?Yet the old brownstone homes and the century-old mansions are being grabbed up again by a rising middle class who look at the convenience of a central location and are thus willing to help rebuild the downtown community.With this trend comes a second problem, known as displacement, of what to do with the people who are uprooted from urban neighborhoods as rents and prices of property rise.But while this issue must be tackled, it appears that America is beginning to develop a little logic again about the value of property being close to where people work.It represents a return to the urban America of old. Greater value is given to property close to urban centers and all they offer in the way of transportation, commerce, culture, and municipal services.But what can banks do about these changing trends so that their appraisal standards and mortgage loans granted today do not lead to defaults later?It is hard to predict which way public tastes will go and what areas of a community will rise or fall in value. Banks in their own right have helped turn communities around by building new facilities in decaying parts of the downtown area. In these cases, the leadership of the bank has raised the value of the bank's own property and of all the surroundings as well.But while uncertainty on location remains, one point is clear: banks and others must begin to make energy more of a consideration in their determination of property value. For properties that are a long way from jobs and that lack mass transportation are bound to suffer in comparison with those where people are more immune to higher priced gas and, more important, to periodic gas shortages.This is one factor in location that can be ignored no longer."
Conn. BA Warns of Outsider Skimming,The American Banker,"April 18, 1979, Wednesday","In a statement released to the press and members of the legislature, Preston C. King, executive vice president, said:""These bank holding company subsidiaries are not coming into Connecticut to loan money to lower-income families; they are coming to the wealth of Connecticut.""Unlike our state banks, they have no obligation under the Community Reinvestment Act to address the entire range of credit needs in the areas they serve.""""If these out-of-state subsidiaries are permitted to establish offices in Connecticut, they will be able to use vast resources against local institutions who lack the large amount of capital to engage in destructive competition.""They can take away the more profitable customers of Connecticut's banks and at the same time decrease the ability, especially of our smaller banks, to serve these segments of our population less fortunate in terms of personal income, including small business.""""The issue which has come to a head in the 1979 Connecticut General Assembly between the commercial banking industry of Connecticut and the nation's second largest bank holding company, the giant $77 billion Citicorp of New York City, is not just a legal difference of opinion as to whether or not Citicorp is within its legal rights in establishing banking offices in Connecticut.""It is also a very basic and fundamental issue which involves the entire Connecticut banking community -- both commercial banks and savings banks, and their role in the future of this state.""The State Senate will consider a measure that would bar all out-of-state bank holding companies and their subsidiaries from the state until 1982. It would also force at least eight outside firms already in the state to close.The state Bank Commissioner, David H.

Illinois Bank Sponsors Jr. Citizen Contest To Single Out the Leaders for the Future,The American Banker,"January 22, 1979, Monday","The winners had to have diversified interests which encompassed their community, church, civic, park, as well as school activities, Ms. Dorgan said.They had to be leaders rather than just members. They had to merit special awards and honors, and render other significant achievements. The students had to be poised, mature and their appearance neat and clean.Each student had to fill out a prepared personal summary history sheet to be submitted to his teacher. A panel then selected one boy and one girl from these history sheets using a prepared judging sheet that determined a score of up to 100% in participation, leadership, aptitude and personal qualities. Using the personal summary history sheets and a personal interview with each winner from each school, another panel of judges from business, education and government picked a Mister and Miss Junior Citizen for 1978-79.A testimonial banquet for the representatives, their parents, principals of each school and VIP guests was held in their honor and the winners announced. They were Mary Lesnefsky, Conrady Hill Junior High School, from Hickory Hills, and Augustus Tai, Conrady, from Palos Hills.The top award for these winners is a trip to Springfield to tour the capitol, meet their legislators and have lunch with the Governor. They will sit on the House floor and be recognized by the Senate.The youngsters appeared on the Ray Rayner Show, Phil Donahue, and Frazier Thomas from Garfield Goose and Family Classics, WGN-TV Channel 9. In the very near future, they will be named mayors of their towns for one day, and have been invited by many community organizations to be honored for their achievement."
S & L Conversions to Stock Form Hit as Mutual System Threat,The American Banker,"April 23, 1979, Monday","The Council, which sued the Federal Home Loan Bank Board last year in an attempt to halt the conversions, said in a report that the newly formed capital stock S&Ls are too vulnerable to takeover by non-S&L corporations eager to corner a piece of the market. The suit is still pending.""S&L holding companies are profit-oriented,"" the group charged in its latest statement."" They take basic decisions and funds out of the community.""Douglas P. Faucette, director of the securities division at the FHLBB, disagreed with the Council's charges in an interview.""There is a statutory scheme that prohibits upstreaming,"" he said, adding that S&Ls acquired by holding companies are still subject to the Community Reinvestment Act. Mr. Faucette said the Council's charges were ""numerous sweeping generalities which simplify a very complex area.""There were rumblings in the last session of Congress over the growing number of S&L conversions and their effects on accountholders and the community.A spokesman for the House Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs subcommittee on financial institutions was unable to predict Wednesday whether the subject would come up again during the current session.""Nothing is scheduled at this time,"" he said. ""We're busy on five or six other things, but it's always possible.""An aide to Sen. William Proxmire, D., Wis., said last month that the chairman of the senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee considered the conversions illegal, based on findings of 1977 Congressional investigations.The FHLBB adopted regulations governing mutual to capital stock conversions last month. The regulations, which take effect in early May, include restrictions on stock acquisitions by S&L insiders and increase the rights of accountholders.Eighty-three conversion applications are now awaiting FHLBB action. Mr. Faucette said some of these are already on the Board's agenda.""They've conformed their applications to the new regulations,"" he said.The regulations limit stock purchases by all officers and directors to 25% of the total stock sale, and also restrict stock purchases by any one individual to 5% of the total offering.In its recent report, the Council charged the Bank Board is ""trying"" to convert S&Ls to the capital stock form.Mr. Faucette responds that the Board favors neither form of organization.""Our position is not to promote one form over the other,"" he said. ""The Board just wants to give people the option.""He said the FHLBB sees increased accountability as one benefit that comes from conversion to capital stock. The capital stock companies are required to file reports on their activities quarterly, and must perform a detailed public accounting annually.The Council's report is supplemented by a roster of recent S&L conversions and acquisitions compiled from FHLBB and Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. data, and information from various financial services.According to the group's estimates, S&L holding companies now control more than 70% of all capital stock S&L assets. The Council said 10% of all the capital stock assets are controlled by non-S&L corporations, like National Steel Corp. and Sears, Roebuck & Co.The group urged that both conversions and further acquisition of capital stock S&Ls be prohibited until Congress investigates the issue.""If the mutual S&L system, comprising 83% of all S&Ls, is to be changed, it should be done by Congress,"" the Council said."
Citibank Gets NYC Mandate on Flatbush,The American Banker,"May 15, 1979, Tuesday","Under the new arrangement, the $60.8 billion-deposit Citibank independently makes all underwriting decisions on Participation Loan Program applications, within guidelines agreed upon by both the bank and the city. These decisions involve such matters as the scope and cost estimates of rehab work, the percentage of the loan taken by the city, rent increases and approval of construction bids, explained Marguerite O. Pitts, one of seven Citibank officials staffing the bank's pilot project in Flatbush.This is the farthest the city has gone in turning over a larger part of the responsibility for packaging loans to a bank, said Jeffrey Heintz, assistant commissioner for rehabilitation in the city Department of Housing Preservation and Development.In Flatbush, Citibank also is simplifying borrowing by working closely with apartment building owners to develop workable loan structures and by finding private lenders to write the long-term mortgages.Long-term mortgages on multifamily buildings are provided through PLP at low interest rates, with about half the mortgage money coming from the city, at 1% interest, and the rest coming from private lenders at market rates. However, in the four years since PLP was established, few loans have been made, due to the number of parties involved in the funding and the inexperience of borrowers.The significance of Monday's announcement, Mrs. Pitts said, was that the number of parties making decisions in the PLP was reduced from three to two: Citibank and the owner. Borrowers, under the Citibank plan, receive extensive assistance in structuring the loan and in finding a long-term lender.Then, Citibank provides the initial construction loan used to finance the renovations. When this work is completed, the cost of renovation is paid out in the long-term participation loan.The press conference was held at 1745 Caton Ave., site of a 58-unit building where Citibank on April 10 closed its first loan through the PLP.Citibank made a $751,000 construction loan to pay for a new roof, as well as new boiler, windows, baths, kitchens and appliances.On the Caton Avenue building, Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. committed $366,000 at 9.5% and New York City committed $385,000 at 1%, both for a 25-year term. Effective interest thus is about 6%. Federal Section 8 rent subsidies will be available, as needed, on PLP rehab building in Flatbush.The City's 1% money comes from Federal Community Development Block Grant funds.Charles Forsberg, president of Citicorp Community Development, Inc., said: ""We hope our efforts to simplify money borrowing will increase the volume of housing rehabilitation and encourage the regrowth of Flatbush. We hope to close $8 million by Oct. 1 and are considering proposals for $4 million more.""Mr. Heintz said that Citibank's commitment to a neighborhood was unique, especially since the pilot project is what he termed a ""money-loser."" He said he hoped to encourage other banks ""to adopt a neighborhood"" in other areas which require stabilization, and to obtain a mandate similar to Citibank's or to pledge money for long-term loans. One such area, he said, is Pelham Parkway in the Bronx.The city official observed that Citibank's stabilizing efforts in Flatbush actually were very similar to what the city's HPD attempts. He said an effort similar to Citibank's role in the PLP has been played in Washington Heights and Crown Heights by the New York City Community Preservation Corp., funded by savings and commercial banks."
Lehman Expands Its Bond Indexes,The American Banker,"February 15, 1979, Thursday","The total return for the Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb Bond Index, combining all public-rate domestic industrial, utility and financial bonds rated ""Baa"" or better, was minus 1.45% for December, minus 2.40% for the fourth quarter, and plus 0.35% for the year 1978.Community banks were advised this week to leave the master trust business to the largest institutions and instead purchase the services they need.Charles A. Moran, vice president of the $30 billion-deposit Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., New York, was a panelist at a community banker program which launched the national trust conference in Los Angeles.""There is no sense for a medium-size bank to consider playing around in the master trust business, he declared.In a master trust, a bank is named trustee for a corporate pension fund but it only keeps custody of the assets and invests them at the direction of outside portfolio managers designated by the fund sponsor.Mr. Moran, who is chairman of the employees trust committee of the American Bankers Association, sponsor of the conference, said that in a few years the master trust business will be concentrated in a few banks.""I can't imagine more than 10 to 12 banks messing around with that business and if I were in the shoes of many of you, I think I'd be very happy watching that happen, looking at those institutions as wholesalers of services,"" he said.On the House side, Rep. Barber B. Conable R., N.Y., has introduced a repeal measure too but it also has provisions relating to farm land, generation skipping and other matters.Administration witnesses are scheduled to testify before Mr. Byrd on March 12. The ABA and others are scheduled for hearings on March 19 and 20."
IBA Policies Opposed by Chain,The American Banker,"April 9, 1979, Monday","In a statement, the Oberwortmann chain said that along with other proponents of multi bank holding companies it would seek to challenge Illinois BA policy opposing multi bank firms during the association's annual convention June 6 in Chicago.James D. Oberwortmann, head of the 26-bank chain and vice chairman of the $154.1 million-deposit Union National Bank & Trust Co. of Joliet, said the issue of introducing multibank firms in the state must now be addressed by the banking trade group because of the ""menacing competitive threat"" posed by savings and loan associations and credit unions.Mr. Oberwortmann explained that S&L's, in particular, have received wide latitude on branching authority and in his community alone one S&L, has established six area offices offering a broad range of lending services. His own bank, meanwhile, is limited to two limited service facilities.Mr. Oberwortmann said his resolution to the Illinois BA asks the 1,010 member trade group to ""support the concept of multi bank holding companies, but limit them to specific geographic regions.""The resolution said, however, the association should continue its opposition to statewide multi bank firms.""I cannot believe the Illinois Bankers Association will continue to ignore the legitimate needs of Illinois banks for some modest structure flexibility,"" said the Joliet banker.Under recently adopted Illinois BA bylaws, policy resolutions are to be submitted to the association's Chicago office 60 days prior to the annual convention.It was uncertain what support the Oberwortmann resolution might gain among members of the Illinois BA which for nearly 20 years has repeatedly turned back attempts to alter its position against the introduction of multi bank holding companies as well as branching.In 1974 the structure issue split the trade group forcing an exodus of banks to organize the Association for Modern Banking in Illinois. Banks in the Oberwortmann chain retain dual membership in both the Illinois BA and AMBI.In a related development Friday, William L. Hood Jr. corporate counsel for the Continental Illinois National Bank & Trust Co., Chicago, told bank correspondents enabling legislation on electronic banking stands a good chance of passing during the current session of the Illinois legislature because of support from a wide spectrum of banks as well as retailers, credit unions and savings & loans.The Continental attorney said industry support has galvanized around a bill drafted by the Illinois Electronic Funds Transfer Study Commission to be introduced in the State Senate on Monday by Sen. Prescott Bloom, R., Peoria, allowing establishment by banks of four unmanned automated teller machines per year in contiguous counties.The commission bill, he noted, represents 14 months of work by the panel made up of eight legislators and eight representatives from the financial and retail community. The commission was headed by Daniel N. Quigley, executive vice president of the $321.1-million deposit National Boulevard Bank of Chicago.In his remarks to the correspondents meeting, Mr. Hood, the Continental attorney said two other EFT bills backed by the Illinois Bankers Association and Independent community Banks in Illinois are flawed because of the ""zillions of antitrust questions"" raised in the language of the proposed legislation.The Illinois BA bills, he said, call for creation of a central switch operated by a ""funds transfer corporation"" with 200 banks as members. The separate corporations, which would separate EFT networks he noted resemble an existing Chicago-based EFT firm, Electronic Funds Illinois Inc. which has 650 Illinois banks as stock holders."
"MHT, Nine Mutual Branch Bids Being Protested Under CRA",The American Banker,"July 27, 1979, Friday","The Manufacturers application is one of 10 CRA-protested applications currently pending at the NYSBD, a department spokesman said last week.In the Manufacturers challenge, South Brooklyn Against Investment Discrimination, an anti-redlining group in Park Slope, Brooklyn, said that the bank has failed to respond to housing needs in Brooklyn and in fact has demonstrated an ""almost complete lack of response"" to credit needs of Brooklyn residents.A Manufacturers spokesman declined last week to reply to AID's charges and said that the bank is studying AID's comments and will send a formal response to the Federal Reserve Board.Manufacturers, AID said, has a portfolio of only $20 million in residential mortgages in Brooklyn though it holds nearly $1 billion in deposits at its 45 Brooklyn branches. The bank's loan portfolio contains only about a dozen loans on multi-family buildings in Brooklyn, AID added.In addition, Manufacturers is not responding to a need in Park Slope for construction or rehabilitation loans of under $1.5 million, the AID submission said.AID said it analyzed all residential property transfers in Park Slope from March 16, 1978, to January 15, 1979, by reviewing the Brooklyn Real Estate Register. During this period, it found, 251 one- and two-family homes were sold, with 55% financed by lending institutions. Two of the 251 were financed by Manufacturers Hanover, compared to 52 by the $61.5 billion-deposit Citibank and 11 by the $24.9 billion-deposit Chemical Bank.The analysis also shows that during that nine-month period, 238 buildings with three or more families were sold, with none of the buildings financed by Manufacturers Hanover.AID also charged that the bank had very restrictive mortgage lending policies, for example limiting conventional mortgage lending to one- and two-family buildings.In its submission, AID included statements of three Park Slope businessmen showing that there is unmet demand for small business loans and that Manufacturers is not meeting it. AID noted that it has asked the bank for data on its small business lending in Brooklyn.AID was the protester in the only CRA case thus far which has resulted in a denial. AID objected to a branch application of the $1.5 billion-deposit Greater New York Savings Bank, Brooklyn, denied April 23 by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.Manufacturers, which is seeking approval for a branch in the Boro Park section of Brooklyn, currently has three branches in Park Slope. The bank includes all of Brooklyn as part of its community on its CRA map.The NYSBD spokesman said that, in addition to the Manufacturers challenge, applications for regular branches which are pending with CRA challenges are: the $521.8 million-deposit North Side Savings Bank, the Bronx, protested by Bank on the Bronx and the Northwest Bronx Community and Clergy Coalition; the $817.8 million-deposit Western New York Savings Bank, Buffalo, by the New York Public Interest Research Group, Inc.; the $424.5 million-deposit Monroe Savings Bank, Rochester, by the Rochester Greenlining Coalition; the $1.4 billion-deposit Franklin Savings Bank of New York, by AID; the $1.7 billion-deposit Seamen's Bank for Savings, by the New Democratic Coalition, and the $1.3 billion-deposit Brooklyn Savings Bank, by NYPIRG, Bank on Brooklyn and by AID.Other pending CRA-protested applications, the spokesman said, have been filed: by Chemical Bank to open an electronic branch, protested by AID; by the $1.7 billion-deposit Metropolitan Savings Bank, Brooklyn, to open a public accommodation office, protested by Bank on Brooklyn, and by the $3.3 billion-deposit New York Bank for Savings to merge Guardian Federal Savings & Loan Association, Northport, into the savings bank, protested by AID.The applications for regular branches and for a public accommodation office will be decided by the NYSBD Banking Board, whereas the merger and electronic branch applications will be decided by Superintendent of Banks Muriel Siebert, according to the NYSBD spokesman.Under the proposed merger, Guardian Federal, in three virtually simultaneous steps, will convert to a state-chartered S&L, will convert to a state-chartered savings bank, and then will be merged into the New York Bank for Savings, according to a NYSBD official.Herb Steiner, chairman of AID, said AID had given notice that it may want to protest the application of Chemical Bank because the group's preliminary research indicated the possibility of CRA-related problems.In the Brooklyn Savings Bank challenge, NYPIRG said that the bank ""has consistently invested minimal amounts in Brooklyn over the years."" It added that 70% of the bank's total 1978 deposits were located in its Brooklyn branches but Brooklyn mortgages constituted only 7% of the bank's total mortgage portfolio on Jan. 1, 1978.Vincent J. Quinn, chairman and president of Brooklyn Savings, replied that it is ""statistically erroneous"" to relate the bank's investment experience to its total deposits. All deposits except for some cash and short-term holdings are already invested at any given time, he said, and the funds available for new investment depend on the deposit flow in the current year.Brooklyn Savings, Mr. Quinn said, had a bankwide deposit outflow in 1978, and a net deposit outflow (exclusive of dividends) in its Brooklyn branches in 1977 and 1978. Further, the makeup of its deposits has changed dramatically with somewhat more than 21% of its deposits currently placed in high-interest six-month money market certificates.Although the percentage of Brooklyn deposits to the bank's total deposits has fallen from the 80% range to the 60% range from 1972 to 1978, the percentage of the bank's Brooklyn mortgages to its total mortgage portfolio has risen each year, Mr. Quinn said.Meanwhile, concerning the Franklin Savings application, Mr. Steiner said that, during negotiations with AID, the bank agreed to the following AID requests: liberalizing underwriting terms; starting to advertise about availability of mortgage and home improvement loans; hiring an urban loan specialist, and designating a much bigger community on its CRA map.Franklin president John T. Morgan confirmed that the bank did agree to those requests. He explained that the bank was responding to its obligation under CRA and to ""the expectations of regulators.'Mr. Morgan said the bank never had been a large retail lender over the years but now was a more aggressive retailer of mortgages. Franklin, he said, had always complied with the letter and spirit of the law. Now, however, banks were being asked to respond to CRA considerations in addition to the traditional standards of prudent banking practice, he said.Mr. Morgan said discussions with AID and others have been ""open and candid,"" and Mr. Steiner said the bank had shown ""good faith"" throughout discussions. However, AID thus far has not withdrawn its protest to the application, Mr. Steiner said.AID's submission held that Franklin made mortgage originations of $325,000 in Brooklyn in 1977, a year in which the deposits in its Brooklyn branches totaled $481 million.And, in a protest dated July 9 and not included in the NYSBD'S list, the New York City Commission on Human Rights objected to an application of the $1.5 billion-deposit Anchor Savings Bank to relocate a branch from Bayside, Queens, to Boro Park, Brooklyn.The commission claimed that Anchor has a ""virtually non-existent"" mortgage investment record in the east Bronx communities comprising community planning district.9.It said the bank did not make a single loan in these communities in 1976 and 1977, though the Westchester Square branch which serves them had deposits of $50,051,000.John Dolan, vice president and mortgage officer at Anchor, pointed out that Anchor did not have any branch in the Bronx prior to its merger with the North New York Savings Bank on Oct. 1, 1977. Anchor's record in the east Bronx communities understandably was virtually non-existent since the bank concentrates on its branch areas, he said.On the other hand, Anchor's investment in housing exceeded $5.5 million in 1978 in the east Bronx neighborhoods cited in the objection, Mr. Dolan said. This amount consisted of originations of 15 mortgages worth $500,000, and secondary market purchases of 130 mortgages worth $5 million. Anchor received 32 mortgage applications at its east Bronx office in 1978, Mr. Dolan said.Since the merger, he said, Anchor has loaned in the Bronx almost 30% of its entire deposit base there, despite a trend of deposit losses after the intial merger gain.Mr. Dolan said the commission did not discuss Anchor's lending record in the east Bronx with Anchor before it filed the protest.The commission describes the east Bronx as an integrated neighborhood where housing stock is sound though deteriorating, and in a few cases abandonment are starting to appear. The east Bronx is among a half-dozen communities which the commission has designated as neighborhood stabilization areas, in a program designed to preserve the viability of transitional neighborhoods."
California S&Ls Meet CRA Challenges Through Affirmative Lending Programs,The American Banker,"October 30, 1979, Tuesday","This fact was born out in the results obtained from two surveys of affirmative lending activities by California S&Ls that were conducted in 1978 and 1979 by the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco. In each case, the surveys were designed to identify the types of programs being offered, as a means of generating further interest among S&Ls in these activities.The 1978 survey, conducted before the Community Reinvestment Act was implemented, focused only on affirmative lending activities that went beyond those required at that time by statute and regulation. All 164 California S&Ls were surveyed and responses were received from 110 associations, of which 88 indicated they were involved in some kind of affirmative lending activity that met the survey's criterion.Early in 1979, a second survey was made of the 170 existing savings and loans in the state. By that time, the CRA was in effect and the premise upon which the intital survey was based had to be altered since virtually all affirmative lending programs could be said to fall within statutory and regulatory requirements. As a result, all 111 respondents in the survey reported some type of activity designed to increase mortgage lending in inner-city or rural areas.While marked differences were apparent in the two surveys, caution should be used in placing too much importance on an apparent surge in the number of S&Ls participating in various categories of affirmative lending activities in 1979 as compared with 1978. Many associations that were counted among participants in a certain activity in 1979 were participants in the previous year as well, but were not included in that year based on a judgement that their participation was not beyond the scope of regulatory requirement. Regardless of the less stringent evaluation used in the 1979 survey, however, the numbers are impressive and there is no doubt that there has been a considerable expansion in affirmative lending activities by associations in California.The CRA is not the only new program that has affected the affirmative lending picture in California. In 1978, the Community Reinvestment Fund was established by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. Designed to stimulate savings and loan mortgage lending in cities and mature rural communities, the $10 billion, five-year fund makes quarterly allocations at below-market rates to member institutions that demonstrate leadership in revitalizing and developing communities throughout the nation.The Eleventh District's share of the fund, to be distributed to S&Ls in Arizona, California, and Nevada, will total nearly $1.9 billion by the end of the five years. To qualify for the CIF advances, S&Ls must meet strict criteria that indicate strong involvement in affirmative lending programs. Each of the quarterly offerings to date has been over-subscribed, reflecting the keen interest of Eleventh District associations in the CIF. As a result, the funds have been allocated on the basis of the ratio of total dollars to the amount of funds available at each offering.Through October 15, 1979, 72 Eleventh District associations had qualified for the CIF, and a total of $561 million had been disbursed. By leveraging these funds in combination with local, state, and Federal programs, a far greater amount has therefore been made available to help low- and moderate-income families meet their housing needs. A review of the types of affirmative lending programs in which California S&Ls reported they were involved indicates the diversity of these activities.Special solicitation in low- and moderate-income areas. In the 1978 survey, 51 S&Ls stated that they made a special effort to solicit loans in low- and moderate-income areas. The 1979 questionnaire was more specific on this topic and disclosed that 47 S&Ls have affirmative lending departments with the primary responsibility of generating loans in low- and moderate-income areas; 72 associations provide special training for loan personnel to improve their loan marketing in those areas; 55 associations target some of their advertising to foreign language or minority media; and 9 S&Ls have special lending units serving low- and moderate-income areas outside their regular marketing areas.Home loan counseling centers. The home loan counseling center concept was first developed in Los Angeles and has since spread to other areas of the country. In 1979, centers were operating in Los Angeles at two locations and in Oakland, San Diego, and East Palo Alto. At the time of the 1978 survey, only the centers in Los Angeles and San Diego were in existence. Centers also are being planned for Sacramento, East San Jose, Orange County, San Bernardino, Santa Ana and El Centro.Each of the centers has the same objective: to provide free home loan counseling to potential homebuyers and homeowners with respect to the purchase and refinancing of homes, rehabilitation loans, and home improvement loans. In many cases, individuals in the areas being served by the centers have only limited knowledge of real estate finance, particularly the options available for financing home improvements. The centers are financed and operated jointly by a group of savings and loans in the areas where they are located. In 1979, 56 S&Ls were participating in this type of activity, compared with 31 in the 1978 survey.Savings associations mortgage company. Commonly known as SAMCO, the savings association mortgage company was organized by a group of S&Ls in the San Francisco Bay area to find ways to stabilize the flow of mortgage credit to low-income neighborhoods. At the time of the 1979 survey, SAMCO had 32 S&L stockholders, up from 27 in 1978. Among SAMCO's progress is the formation of loan pools, by originating or purchasing loans on low-income properties. The organization then sells 100% interest in the pools to its S&L stockholders in the form of participation certificates.The ready access to a secondary market provided by this operation has both enabled and encouraged savings and loans with offices located in or near low-income neighborhoods to originate a higher-than-normal volume of these loans. As of July, 1979, SAMCO was servicing more than $28 million in loans on single-family and senior citizen multi-family dwellings. SAMCO also operates the home loan counseling center in Oakland, mentioned previously.Community housing advisory activities. Forty-five savings and loans reported involvement in some type of city, county or area effort to develop programs for the purpose of rehabilitating or preserving established neighborhoods. Twenty-four S&Ls reported such activities in the first survey. The extent of involvement varied from program to program, but usually included advisor services by S&L officials and sometimes direct financial support. The task force approach seems to have gained considerable popularity, with a number of S&Ls reporting involvement with community groups and local government agencies to seek solutions to the housing and related neighborhood problems of their communities.Neighborhood housing services. The neighborhood housing services concept is one of the better known nationwide programs designed to increase lending by financial institutions in neighborhoods showing early signs of disinvestment and deterioration. The goal of NHS is to demonstrate how a neighborhood can be ""turned around"" by residents acting in cooperation with local financial institutions and local government. California has five NHS projects in operation, including Oakland, La Habra, Inglewood, Menlo Park and Pasadena. Approximately 30 S&Ls in California were supporting NHS projects when the 1979 survey was made, up from 20 the previous year.Rehabilitation of inner-city housing. In the 1978 survey, 13 California savings and loans reported individual or cooperative lending programs specifically designed to rehabilitate existing homes or apartment buildings in inner-city areas. In 1979, 30 S&Ls indicated participation in such activities. The scope of these activities varies widely, ranging from individual projects to participation with community and local government organizations in redevelopment programs.Individual S&L home loan counseling programs. In addition to home loan counseling centers sponsored by groups of S&Ls, a growing number of associations have instituted home loan counseling programs of their own. The 1979 survey showed 98 S&Ls involved in some type of counseling effort, versus only 12 in 1978. These activities included the sponsorship of seminars on home construction and repair and related financing, the assignment of bilingual loan counselors to branches in or near minority areas, and the provision of interpreters to help non-English speaking individuals receive loan counseling.Construction financing in low- and moderate-income areas. The most significant increase in affirmative lending activities between the two surveys appeared to be in construction financing in low- and moderate-income areas. In 1978, 11 S&Ls reported recent lending activity for financing construction of new single-family dwellings located in minority or low-income areas. The related question on the 1979 questionnaire inquired about multifamily housing, as well, and received 70 positive responses from S&Ls.The 1979 survey also revealed a growing trend toward ""in-fill"" construction - that is, constructing dwellings on single lots within previously built neighborhoods. Such construction may now be more profitable and attractive to builders and lenders than multi-dwelling building projects as a result of time-consuming and expensive application and permit processes for new developments.Loan purchase from minority S&Ls. In the past eight years, 15 savings and loan associations that are considered to be minority operated have been chartered in California. In an effort to assist these new associations to grow and become more profitable, several established S&Ls have agreed to purchase a specific amount of mortgage loans, usually on a monthly basis, from the minority S&Ls. The major benefit of this activity is the increased supply of mortgage funds made available for minority neighborhoods. At the same time, the minority S&L benefits from the fees collected for originating the loans and from any differential that exists between the interest rate as originated and the interest rate agreed upon in the sale. The 1979 survey indicated that 13 S&Ls had purchased nearly $56 million of such loans during the previous year, compared with five S&Ls and $45.6 million in 1977.Youth programs. Looking toward the homeowners of tomorrow, 16 S&Ls indicated involvement in programs designed to help young people learn construction trades, prepare for a career in the savings and loan industry, or prepare for homeownership. Only two associations reported programs of this type in the 1978 survey. Among the activities reported were work programs in S&Ls for high school seniors, informational workshops for young, first-time homebuyers, and home rebuilding and construction projects.Federal, state, and local programs.In addition to the unique affirmative lending programs developed by individual or groups of savings and loans, California associations are participating in various Federal, state and local programs with increasing frequency. Community Development Block Grant funds, administered by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, are being used in a variety of ways to provide additional housing for low-income families, and California S&Ls have likewise taken advantage of programs offered through the Farmers Home Administration and the Federal National Mortgage Association. The California Housing Finance Agency, an independently governed part of the state's Business and Transportation Agency, is another important source of funds for low-income housing, and the number of S&Ls participating in programs offered by the CHFA more than doubled between the two survey dates.Additional details of these activities are available in reports of the two surveys published by the bank. Copies of the reports may be obtained from the public information department, Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco, P.O. Box 7498, San Francisco, Ca., 94120.Picture, MILTON FEINERMAN"
Foreign Competition With The Small-Medium US Bank,The American Banker,"March 23, 1979, Friday","While the large US banks with worldwide operations and networks of branches have by and large had little difficulty in holding their own in this increasingly competitive climate, many smaller and medium-size US banks have voiced a certain concern about the prospects of having to compete with large international banks in their home market.Undoubtedly, the advent of one or several powerful international banks into a previously sheltered market prove a traumatic experience for banks already established there. But the perceived threat of foreign competition can be perceived threat or even turned to advantage by individual banks whose management is willing to put aside the perhaps natural feelings of fear and resentment and adopt instead a practical, reasoned response to the challenge.The very first point to be realized in this context is that the foreign banks have come to the US as much because they have had to, as because they have wanted to. Banking has undergone a dramatic change in the post-war period. As commerce and industry have gone multinational, so have the banks.The demands from business for local financing or foreign markets, and for expert advice on international financing possibilities and foreign exchange rate developments have prompted a large number of banks to rise to these demands by establishing branches, subsidiaries and other forms of representation in a large number of key areas around the world.Lest anyone feel that the influx of foreign banks into the US is somehow unique, let me recall that, from the earliest post-war years, US banks have been in the forefront of this internationalization trend. Indeed, most of the foreign banks now spreading out throughout the US were very much on the receiving end of international competition through the 50's and 60's.And the lessons we learned then may hold great value for US banks facing foreign competition now.In market after market around the world, the realization has come quickly, and sometimes painfully, that this internationalization of banking was here to stay. Attempts to combat the trend have often been costly and always unsuccessful. Banks which have tried to simply ignore the development in the hope that it might go away, have been rudely awakened to the realities of life.A majority of banks facing the challenge of foreign competition have quickly learned to cope with the new situation by adopting a few policies, simple in theory, but requiring a certain amount of flexibility and creative thinking to accomplish in practice:Recognize your advantages and build your future strategy on them.Study your competitors and adapt your strategy accordingly and,If you can't beat them, join them.1. Every bank active in its native environment has enormous advantages over any foreign bank invading its territory. The domestic bank has a well established name in the market, good personal contacts with authorities, industry and commerce, presumbly a well developed network of branches or other sources of domestic deposits, and it can play on feelings of ethnic, linguistic and national community.These are formidable obstacles for any foreign bank to overcome, and experience has shown that, in the vast majority of cases, foreign banks moving into a specific community tend to avoid those areas where the local banking community has the strongest advantages, i.e., retail banking.Rather, foreign banks typically trade on their one advantage over domestic banks --tend to seek out the available international business in the market. In doing so, they have a fairly limited target range of potential customers in each country and a relatively modest use for local funds. Thus, most of their funds will come from the international money market, with foreign banks moving into a new area generally preferring to turn to local banks as the easiest and most convenient sources of whatever limited local funds may be needed.The local banking community is probably wise to supply these, as the alternative can be very troublesome. A large international bank, determined to gain a foothold in a specific market, can be a formidable and stubborn competitor and shoudl it find no other way to satisfy its requirements for domestic funds than to develop into retail banking, it will take the trouble and the expense to do so.As long as the foreign banks don't choose to develop into retail banking, they have a limited scope of activities in the market and will remain relatively unimportant factors in the community.Certainly, they will pick up some business in the area -- which is a good portion of their purpose in coming there in the first place -- but the local banking community will still be the only source of full-service banking, which constitutes a powerful competitive tool.2. Study your competition and act accordingly. A bank active in the international market, through trial and error, has developed sophisticated techniques designed to fulfill the requirements of its customers at the lowest possible cost while at the same time generating a fair amount of profit for the bank.Admittedly, sometimes this service is based on the large international banks' ability to place at their customers' disposal a worldwide network of branches. However, this is true much less frequently than is normally believed. In most cases, the service supplied is based on the human resources the international banks have at their disposal: experts in various fields of banking activities drawing on long personal experience in the market and being accustomed to working as a team to place their joint experience to the service of the customer.Even if the local bank cannot realistically expect to assemble and support such teams of experts on its own, it can surely learn, copy and further develop the techniques developed by such teams.Then, too, large international banks do not pick up only positive features in the international market. As they grow, they tend to experience growth pains of various sorts. Probably the two most common of these are a sharply increased tendency towards bureaucratic procedures and serious disturbances in communication between the various parts of their international network.These problems may manifest them selves in a slowing down of the decision making process, increased rigidity in methods and procedures and frequent shifts of personnel which disrupt the formation of personal contacts between bank and customers.3. ""If you can't beat them, join them."" This proberb is most applicable also in this case. It can be applied in two main ways by US banks feeling the threat of income foreign banks:Join forces witht the foreign banks by offering them assistance in the fields in which they are lacking, especially local knowhow and know-who, in exchange for something the international banks might possess of interest to the US bank. By establishing a working relationship with a foreign newcomer, the US bank can help to forestall more serious competition down the road, can enhance its own ability to service its customers' needs in areas in which it has no special expertise or experience (e.g. trade financing, exchange hedging) and can even deal itself into new business opportunities which never existed for it before (e.g. being invited into participations by the foreign banker, gaining improved access to international funds, etc.).The US bank might go international itself, concentrating on certain areas of banking activities where it feels it has an edge over the majority of foreign banks. If this is a special knowledge of certain fields of industry, certain financing techniques, etc., chances are that these techniques can be profitably applied also in other countries.If foreign banks are coming into the US to cut a slice of the US pie for themselves by applying specialized knowledge, there is really no reason why smaller US banks with specialized knowhow should not look abroad for slices of the foreign pie.To sum up: The banking industry is faced with an irreversible trend towards internationalization. Fighting the trend can be very costly and is virtually always useless. Rather than oppose it, try to pick up on the opportunities this trend offers. Evaluate the market, but, even more important, evaluate your self and your possibilities.Chances are that once the process of adapting to the new situation has been accomplished, the fields of concentration (and the clients) will be somewhat different from what they were before. But if you meet the chanllenge of foreign bank competition with open eyes and an open mind, you have every possibility not only of surviving the onslaught, but also of coming out ahead.Picture, Bror V.

Dynamic Trends Evident in Austrian Banking Industry,The American Banker,"January 22, 1979, Monday","One indicator of the dynamic trend prevailing in the banking community is the number of the credit institutions' employees. In the years between 1967 and mid-1978 it grew from some 29,000 to about 56,000, as compared to the increase of the overall employment figure by circa 120,000 to some 3.3 million. The expansion of the credit sector has primarily been attributable to two factors:The exceptional rise of prosperity and in particular the increase in mass income This is also reflected in the national income figures: the share of mass income in the national income rose in the past ten years from approx. two thirds to just under three quarters.A growing portion of Austrian goods and services is exported. Foreign business as well as banking as the necessary vehicle for it gain continually in importance.A third and essential factor is the fast growth of public financing requirements which to an ever growing extent are met by the banking community.These are the main features which mutatis mutandis are true of all Western industrial countries and which have decisively influenced the traditional business policies of the individual sectors of the Austrian banking system. Shifts in the market positions, the orientation to new customer groups and a growing uniformity of the offer of services frequently occured almost unnoticed. They were overshadowed by the general growth and by the tempo of global expansion. The country's largest sector in terms of balance sheet total, the commercial banks, increased their market share by four percentage points to over one third between 1967 and 1977. The second largest group, the savings banks, lost ground somewhat, holding presently not quite one fourth of the market, whereas the third largest group, the rural credit cooperatives, achieved a market share of some 18% and thus gained almost two percentage points as compared to 1967.
International business as a motor of growthBetween 1967 and 1977 the share of international business in the balance sheet totals of the Austrian credit institutions grew from approx. 5% to just under 15%.It is a result of the increasingly stronger activities of the banking community in the financing and handling of the Austrian foreign trade, but likewise the result of an ever more visible presence of the large Austrian banks in the international financial markets. The annual growth of foreign business in the banking community as a whole exceeded 30% as compared with the growth of the domestic business by 16%.Approximately three-fourths of the foreign assets are held by the commercial banks -- a share almost unchanged over the ten years, which reflects the exceptional growth of this part of business in the balance sheet totals of Creditanstalt and Landerbank in particular, as well as the expansion of Osterreichische Kontrollbank. The central institutions of the savings banks' and rural credit cooperatives' sectors have also increasingly entered international business.
Fierce competition for the domestic customerThe relatively narrow domestic market, characterized by strong economic growth and marked sociological shifts among the economic sectors and, as has been mentioned already, between employees and self-employed persons, encouraged a remarkable competition for the domestic bank customer.This competition disregarded and still disregards the historically grown boundaries among the individual sectors.The commercial banks continue to be the main financiers for industry and commerce, although they have ceded market shares to other sectors in recent years. On the other hand -- this reflecting a new business strategy -- they succeeded in achieving an important role as lenders to private customers.This also holds to the financing of trade and the extension of loans to public authorities, though not quite to this extent. In this way a more balanced clientele structure was achieved. A major activity of the commercial banks is export financing, two thirds of which are handled through this sector.Savings banks, which were able to maintain their position as lenders almost unchanged over the ten years, did lose their predominance in the private customer business, yet they were able to gain market shares in loans to commerce and industry. They asserted their strong position in the extension of loans to public bodies. Housing continues to be one of the traditional cores of the savings banks' loan policy.As a result of a marked diversification, in particular of the entering into urban customer groups, rural credit cooperatives, the classical lenders to agriculture were able to strengthen their market position as lenders to many customer groups, especially to private customers and to public bodies.An important and constantly growing role in the financing of the private sector is played by the building societies, which, on account of government subsidies, offer special conditions both for deposits and for loans.
Hotly contested deposit businessA fierce battle is fought for the deposits of private customers. As the obvious winner of these endeavors the private customer emerged, to whom not only a very dense branch network is available, but also a comprehensive offer of all modern banking services at very lost cost, frequently even at nil expense.However, despite high stakes of all competitors the market shares have remained extremely resistant over the past years.The commercial banks were more or less able to maintain their position, recording, though, a distinct shift from demand and time deposits -- more attractive in terms of costs -- towards the dearer yet long-term banks' own issues. The savings banks, above all, had to forgo from their predominant market share in savings deposits, which was 41% in 1967, as much as 6% in the decade until 1977: partly to rural credit cooperatives with their dense branch network, and, in a considerable degree, to the building societies, as well as the commercial banks, yet to a smaller extent.Although not reflected by the only insignificantly altered market positions the reshaping of institutions, the remodeling of the banks' image, the change in the style of marketing were most clearly marked in the deposit business. The new strategies produced lasting impacts on management, organization and planning of the institutions.
The banking sector, mainstay of the capital marketThe Austrian bond market, an inconspicuous wallflower even ten years ago, has experienced an explosive development in recent years, which is attributable to changes in the financing requirements of the economy.The commercial banks, with their placing power lead the business. They underwrite to almost half of the bond issues open to public subscription. This market position is the result of the long-standing support of the capital market and its participants.The savings banks, guaranteeing some 30% of the volume of issues, also pass on a considerable portion to their customers, yet, following their traditional investment policy, continue to acquire large parts for their own portfolios.The increasing share of funded debt in the balance sheets of all big credit institutions in Austria is another proof of the predominance of the universal bank in the Austrian banking community.
Universal bank - determining type of the Austrian credit institutionAlthough the traditional emphases in business are still reflected in the balance sheets of the credit institutions, the individual sectors converge more and more in their business policies, their appearance, their advertising activities, and in their services. The legal and institutional framework has now been adapted to this development, which determines the image of the Austrian banking sector.Both the banking law and the new savings bank law, which are about to be passed, as well as the full banking licence already granted to the previous instalment houses underline this global tendency of uniformization of the Austrian credit institutions towards the universal bank.
Comments on the further developmentThe reform of their legal bases entails a further increase of competitive pressure for the credit institutions over years. The starting conditions are now more or less the same for all sectors. The strict banking secrecy becomes legally established, the requirements of own resources are laid down to amount as a rule to 4% of the liabilities. There is a tendency to increase the supervision and control possibilities of the Federal Ministry of Finance.However, a liberalization aimed at an important issue for years was achieved: since mid-1977 no permit has been necessary to set up new branches. All sectors of the banking community -- also those with an already dense branch network -- are now free to adapt their branch policy to the laws of the market, not to the regulations of authorities. Thus the commercial banks, having already embarked upon the private customer business, can now devote far more efforts to this market. Last but not least, the foreign banks and representative offices domiciled in Austria get more development opportunities to improve their market share of about 3%.Anyway, the times of regionally limited and traditionally tied structures in the Austrian banking system have already become part of the history of domestic banking."
2d NJ Banking Kidnaping in 5 Years,The American Banker,"July 24, 1979, Tuesday","The latest was Joan Dedrick, whose husband, William Dedrick, is executive vice president of the $82.1 million-deposit Franklin Bank of Paterson.Mrs. Dedrick was seized Friday morning at the Dedrick home in West Milford, N.J., and was released unharmed early Sunday morning after her husband paid a $217,000 ransom. Four Paterson residents have been arrested by FBI agents for the crime, but the ransom money has not been recovered.The men were ordered held on $250,000 bail today by U.S. Magistrate William Hunt. In a hearing before the court, Assistant U.S. Attorney William Braniff asked for the high bail citing as reasons ""circumstantial evidence"" against the defendants and ""the fact that there is $217,000 still out there and no doubt the defendants know where it is.""In the previous case, Madeline Fehn was kidnaped on April 29, 1974, from her home in Randolph Township. Her husband, Alvan B. Fehn, a director and officer of the National Community Bank of Rutherford, paid a $200,000 ransom for her freedom. The kidnapers were never caught. Mr. Fehn was president of the National Union Bank of Dover before it was merged with National Community.In each case, cash funds of the bank involved were used to pay the ransom. Whether coverages from insurance companies were involved has not been learned.Blanket bonds bought by banks for protection against crime contain three basic coverages -- infidelity of employees, robbery or holdup on premises and theft of funds in transit. In addition, as part of the bonds they can buy protection against incoming forged documents and loans made on forged securities.Protection against extortion and kidnaping is available as a rider to the insurance.Franklin Bank has a merger deal currently pending with Horizon Bancorp, Morristown-based state-wide bank holding company. Franklin is the bank which originated the bearer-certificate bonds more than a decade ago. This is the bond which was widely copied in recent years until more stringent rules against its use for tax evasion purposes issued by the U.S. Treasury dried up its sales."
BHCs Help End St. L. School Strike,The American Banker,"March 16, 1979, Friday","A group of St. Louis companies, including the $3.5 billion-asset First Union Bancorp. and the $1.7 billion-asset Boatmen's Bancshares, Inc., pledged $600,000 for a special fund to make up the budget deficit anticipated by the St. Louis Board of Education in agreeing to improved teacher salaries and fringe benefits. TThe guarantee by the businesses was offered to the school board during the final stages of negotiations to help it reach an agreement with the teachers and end a 56-day strike.Participating in the guarantee are First Union Bancorp. Anheueser-Busch, Inc., Emerson Electric Co., Ralston Purina Co., Boatmen's Bancshares and six other companies.""In my 24 years of professional experience in education, this is the first time of which I am aware that local, private business interests have stepped forward to assist in helping to resolve a strike by teachers,"" said Robert E. Wentz, superintendent of schools."" This is in keeping with the kind of responsible leadership and support from private business in St. Louis that we have received in recent years.""Charles F. Knight, chairman of Emerson Electric and a director of First Union Bancorp., led the group of 11 businesses that set up the fund.Edwin S. Jones, chairman of the executive committee of First Union, said that some of the community's business leaders decided that the strike ""was eating into the community."" Mr. Jones said that many businesses declined to participate in the fund because of its precedent-setting implications. ""Some felt stronger about breaking a precedent,"" he said. ""Some felt they wanted to take this action; others felt they couldn't justify it in their own minds. Some companies have firm policies (against this sort of thing) in matters like this,"" Mr. Jones said.Donald Brandin, chairman of Boatmen's Bancshares, declined to discuss the corporate contributions except to say ""it's a one-time thing as far as I'm concerned. It's not a precedent for anything.""The two-year salary package which the teachers agreed to this week will result in actual cash payments to all teachers in 1979-80 and 1980-81 of $2,625."
Ore. BHC Seeks Suburban De Novo,The American Banker,"November 29, 1979, Thursday","The move follows by a week an announcement that the holding company hopes to purchase an existing bank in Forest Grove which it would continue to run separately from its major subsidiary, United States National Bank of Oregon.U.S. National is currently prohibited from establishing direct branches in either of the Portland suburbs because of a home office protection law, which was repealed this year. The repeal, however, does not take full effect until 1984. In the meantime, banks in this state are prohibited from establishing a de novo branch in any community of under 50,000 population in which another bank has its home office.Monday, U.S. Bancorp said it had applied for a state charter to create the ""Bank of Milwaukie,"" which it said it would operate as a separate entity from U.S. National, even after the home office rule dies in 1984.Last week, it announced that it has entered into a tentative agreement to purchase the $33.4 million-deposit Forest Grove National Bank, and that the bank would retain the individual community identity if the purchase were consummated.
Moves InfluencedIn both transactions, the holding company has suggested that its moves were influenced by recognition of the value of local community identification. In the case of the Forest Grove bank, for instance, it admitted that under the existing law it could have arranged for U.S. National to have purchased the bank itself and merged the smaller institution. In Monday's announcement, a spokesman for U.S. Bancorp specifically cited the desire to maintain local ""identity and individualism"" for the move to acquire a state charter, while admitting that the holding company was ""of course aware of the home office rule.""In this announcement of the Milwaukee move, the U.S. Bancorp spokesman called the application a ""slightly different approach, although not a ""distinct change"" in its move to expand its branching network.The spokesman said that the holding company is ""constantly looking"" for means of branch expansion. In the earlier Forest Grove announcement, a spokesman suggested that the firm might seek further acquisitions of existing banks to be operated as existing subsidiaries between now and the time the home office rule expires.The home office protection rule was repealed in this year's session of the legislature through the cooperation of the Oregon Bankers Association. Instituted in the 1930s, the law had long been a source of contention between the state's smaller banks and its larger institutions. The repeal was seen as a sign that a rift between the banks -- which a few years ago had resulted in U.S. National and the slightly larger First National Bank of Oregon temporarily pulling out of the Oregon Bankers Association -- had finally been healed.
Repeal SupportedU.S. National and First National between them hold close to 70% of the state's banking deposits. The fact that the smaller banks in the state agreed to support the repeal of the home office protection rule was seen in part as recognition that the law had failed to halt the growth of the bigger banks, and in part a desire to create a united banking front in the state control to effectively deal with banking legislation.While the expansion moves by U.S. Bancorp in the last two weeks appears to some banking observers here as a means to expand while awaiting expiration of the home office rule, others point out that it is not the first this year to announce acquisitions of smaller banks which are to be run as separate subsidiaries. The holding company of Oregon Bank, Portland, has acquired banks in Lincoln City and Grants Pass, both to be retained as separate entities. First State Bank of Oregon is in the process of acquiring separate subsidiaries in Hood River and McMinnville.It was the presence in Milwaukie of the home office of First State Bank that kept U.S. National Bank of Oregon from establishing a direct branch."
Reactions of Memphis Bankers Differ As They Begin to Comply with CRA,The American Banker,"February 6, 1979, Tuesday","On the one hand, a banker at the $24.8 million-deposit, minority-owned Tri-State Bank of Memphis said he was not overly concerned about CRA because ""for years our bank has been making 70% to 80% of its loans"" in the inner city.But on the other hand, executives at the wholesale-banking-oriented $70.2 million-deposit Commerce Union Bank of Memphis said they are uneasy over how regulatory authorities will check for CRA compliance a bank specializing in corporate loans.At a third institution, the $694.6 million-deposit Leader Federal Savings and Loan Association, confident executives have issued a CRA statement for its new urban lending program.The statement, which was printed in a brochure format, will be available for distribution to members of neighborhood improvement associations and other groups that Leader Federal is trying to make more aware of its urban lending efforts.Lenders said preparation for CRA had presented no major problems, at least for now.""A year from now I may say that I had no idea what a monster this would be,"" Robert L. Booth Jr., president and chief executive officer of Commerce Union, said.Mr. Booth, other lenders and regional banking regulators agreed that the jury is still out on local lenders and CRA. ""The crux of the matter will be how we react to what they've done,"" Clifton A. Poole, Memphis-based regional administrator of national banks, said.Mr. Booth said his bank is concerned with examinations specializing in corporate lending. Commerce Union has made inner-city loans of a different type than have other banks.""We've told the Community Development Agency to let us do the commercial loans and the big banks the residential lending, since we don't have mortgage banking experience,"" Mr. Booth said. The agency coordinates inner-city revitalization in Memphis.""We don't see any problems in making inner-city loans. If you make the extra effort, you can find the creditworthy borrower.""CRA has been time-consuming for his bank and others, he said: ""At this point, we feel we spent a lot of time only to find we were already in compliance.""That opinion was echoed by other bankers.""We found in reviewing for CRA we do a fairly decent job of covering all segments of the market,"" William A. Dick, president and chief executive officer of the $169.2 million-deposit Commercial and Industrial Bank, said. ""We don't do any redlining or geo-coding"" (geographic coding).Leader Federal, meanwhile, said it decided the CRA statement provided an opportunity to re-emphasize its urban lending program.While most statements are printed on letter-size sheets, Leader's is in red letters on a 3 1/4 - by - 7 - inch gray-colored card. The Leader logo, CRA information and names of area lending officers are on one side, while the reverse lists loan rates and policies.Russell Brown, director of marketing at Leader, said the cards will be available in branches but will also be mailed to neighborhood improvement associations.Leader also is asking some inner-city churches for permission to insert the cards and other materials in Sunday service bulletins.""We believe many persons in the inner city can qualify for a home loan but don't realize it because they haven't been attuned to thinking about home ownership,"" Mr. Brown said. He said Leader has given a new emphasis to increasing inner-city loans ""because that's where many of our loans have been for 50 years --part of the inner city.""Except for Tri-State Bank, which listed only the city of Memphis as its lending area, lenders said they considered all of Shelby County, including Memphis, as their community.""We make loans throughout the Tennessee-Arkansas-Mississippi region, but we consider Shelby County our principal area,"" said Kenneth W. Patton, vice president in the loan review department of the $753.9 million-deposit Union Planters National Bank. Mr. Patton is the bank's CRA compliance officer.The $1 billion-deposit First Tennessee Bank NA here also said it considers all of Shelby County to be its community. EXecutives at the bank's parent, the $2.3 billion-asset First Tennessee National Corp., supervised compilation of 13 CRA statements-one for each banking subsidiary across Tennessee.Aside from Leader Federal, most lenders said they had not yet begun to implement CRA marketing plans.""I don't think running an advertisement in the local minority-owned newspaper,"" as Memphis banks generally do, ""will meet the requirement of CRA,"" said Commerce Union's Mr. Booth. ""I think more direct mail and other such marketing tools will be needed.""C&I's Mr. Dick said his bank will soon have a marketing plan under way. ""I believe, however, the most critical task in coming months will be to make sure that we continue to be in compliance with CRA.""Mr. Poole said most local institutions now appear to be complying with the initial CRA deadlines.moreHe foresees a positive impact from CRA ""in requiring banks to be more professional in how they do business. Some smaller banks don't plan and don't have written lending policies. They're going to be in trouble if they don't have a plan to back up their CRA statement."""
Time to Push,The American Banker,"August 24, 1979, Friday","The variable-rate mortgage has moved from something bankers whispered about to something that more and more bank and thrift executives are looking at as a solution to many of their problems. And most executives connected with the home lending sector of the financial environment recognize that had VRMs existed at the end of World War Two, thrifts would not be in the bind they are in now, Regulation Q might not have been put in place, and there would not have been the shift of funds away from banks and thrifts and to credit unions, money market funds and other replacement institutions and instruments that the ceilings under Reg. Q have made more and more attractive to the American saver.But it is not only the variable-rate mortgage that needs greater attention from the banking industry.The other new mortgage forms are equally valuable in solving problems, just as the VRM can solve the problem of earning a decent return on mortgage loans in a period of rising interest rates.The sliding-scale mortgage, which requires heavier payments by the borrower as his other income rises, also makes sense in a world of soaring home prices. Without it more and more Americans will be simply priced out of the housing market.Certainly there are times when a mortgage which requires higher payments in later years than in earlier years can leave the bank in a precarious position. The value of the home may not be enough to provide the secure margin over the amount lent for a period of years, just as an auto loan often leaves the bank with a position that is under water for quite a while.But just as the banks have accommodated themselves to the highpercentage-of-value auto loan by knowing the borrower and basing the loan on his integrity rather than the collateral, this approach will have to be utilized more in mortgage lending too.But certainly the innovation that must be given far more attention by bankers and thrift executives alike than it has received up to now is the reverse-annuity mortgage. Such a program, which lends money to help older people hold on to their homes in the face of soaring heatung costs, and rising taxes and maintainance charges, is of tremendous social value and will place the lending institutions in good light throughout the community.Certainly there are problems here too. The homeowner who lives far longer than actuarilly expected must be insured against. Unless the bank has arranged to insure the reverse-annuity mortgage at the time it lends money to the older homeowner, the bank may find that the loan has merely prolonged the need for sale until the homeowner is far older --becoming the major culprit. Thus, loans should be insured so that the homeowner and his spouse can live in the home for the rest of their lives.In addition, the bank should have good communication with the heirs of the older borrowers, so that they recognize the bank now has a first lien on the property after the death of the occupants. And if the heirs really care about the occupants, they will accept this as the price that must be paid so that the older persons can remain in their homes despite inflated costs.These are problems that must be handled.But what worries some observers is that too many bankers have used these problems as an excuse to do nothing. Proponents of the new mortgage forms are still looked upon as iconoclasts by most of the banking community, even though the need for these flexible mortgage forms in today's environment is obvious.If banks simply sit back and lend in traditional forms, they may find themselves not only losing more ground in home-loan financing but also losing more of the other business of the home borrowers who need new mortgage forms, losing the business of their friends and relatives, and losing good will in the community to the institutions that do reshape their mortgage loans to meet today's financial needs."
Partnership with the Arts,The American Banker,"March 28, 1979, Wednesday","Contributions, of course, can be broke into obvious groupings of education, health and welfare, civic activities, culture and the arts. The arts are the fastest growing segment of our donations portfolio. (But in many ways it's unfair to lump the arts with other contribution areas.)American corporations last year contributed nearly $235 million to the visual and performing arts -- more than twice as much as the Federal government gives the National Endowment for the Arts annually. Corporate art support has increased tenfold over the past decade and now represents 11.6% of total corporate contributions to all philanthropic causes.This is not a new role for business. Proprietors of banking, manufacturing and commercial enterprises have promoted culture and the arts since the dawn of commerce.However, there is now a new level of sophistication, scope and quality of the partnerships of arts and business that now can be found in every part of the country.The most encouraging aspect of this development is that once a company has supported the arts, it tends almost invariably to broaden its involvement thereafter.Also, the arts, more swiftly than any other category, are undergoing transformation from philanthropy to an essential expression of corporate responsibility. For the arts this means that business is rapidly becoming a major and reliable source of support.But why should marketing budgets support the arts? There are the basic reasons.The first is that marketing can learn from the arts. We need the arts as much as the arts need us. Without the arts marketing may not have evolved beyond the individual efforts of hawkers, door-to-door salesmen and window dressers.Where artists and designers once served chiefly to assure product utility and aesthetic appeal, they now are called on to bring harmony to the total work environment.Unfortunately, not every business corporation understands that commercial art cannot survive without the flow of insights from independent artists who create for the sake of their art, not from the needs of commerce.American businessmen and women benefit from a flourishing of the arts. But the decentralization of business and industry has also created problems. how do you induce an engineer or MBA or marketing executive to relocate from a large city to a smaller one if all you can promise is a competitive salary?Those who have enjoyed the best our culture has to offer are not likely to be attracted to plant communities that lack a rich and varied environment. Corporations have come to recognize that the arts generate enormous business.Patronage of the arts not only is a uniquely effective instrument for protecting a community's economic well-being but it also is a practical investment in better business. I do not mean to suggest that the arts are the dominant factor in developing a community's economic well-being. Quality living calls for several elements working together.Colorado is attracting business and pleasure seekers alike with its welldeserved reputation for quality living conditions. But in addition the business community backed the $80 million Denver Center for the Performing Arts due for completion in 1979. This diamond in the Rockies features a program of theater, film, music and dance rivaling that of any cultural center in the country. Dance companies include the Denver Civic Ballet, Colorado Concert Ballet and many other fine dance companies. Central City Opera productions entrance young and old alike. The Denver Symphony has achieved national recognition and numerous community orchestras throughout the state provide cultural fare for all ages.The second reason a relationship between marketing and the arts should be encouraged is that the arts can learn from marketing.Too frequently the people who market the arts need a basic course in marketing to (1) help them sell their project to a sponsor and (2) help them sell their product to their market. All of us know how refreshing it is when we see an arts marketer make a professional presentation to OUR needs about a product that uniquely meets them.To a great extent we should teach art marketers to put themselves in our shoes. We should discourage ""hat-in-hand"" beggars. We should encourage art marketing professionalism. If they've done their homework, they have no need to apologize for seeking support. In fact, one of the best ways art marketers can develop this support is to involve marketing people in arts activities. They should seek their planning help, put them on boards and get them involved before the fact.It is still widely assumed that a corporation's decision to support an art project or institution is determined largely by such considerations as its market and the gamut of public relations benefits. And certainly these are major considerations for many companies. But just as corporations initially supported higher education by contributing to specific programs that benefited their own operations and then moved on to unrestricted gifts for liberal education in the arts and sciences, so corporations involved in the arts are increasingly motivated by considerations broader than their own business interests.To be sure, a corporation wants its contributions to enhance its reputation and encourage consumers to buy its products or services.And where public relations is the overriding concern, the following criteria enter into the formulation of our corporate program to support the arts:1. Is the project local?2. How large is the arts audience? Who are in it?3. What are the characteristics of the local arts institution?4. Does the art form relate to the corporation's business activities in the community?5. Is the art consistent in quality and in harmony with the quality reputation of your own institution?6. How unique is the project?7. What's in it for your bank?There are some basic things that fund raisers should be sure of before venturing forth to raise funds:First, be sure the product is as professional as can be createdSecond, be prepared to demonstrate the activity to those people they want to influence.Third, be thoroughly professional in all activities.The third, final and most important reason for an arts/marketing relationship is that the product will be better if we understand how to make the most of each other. That means partnership, not division of labor. Trust, not protecting your turf. It usually means success, not failure.Somehow if you're one of the biggest banks in your community, you're expected to do more. And if your stockholders are alert, you're expected to do it better and with bottom-line effect.We believe that a major step to success is to ""dream big."" Let your creative juices run rampant. That has helped us develop a unique fund-raising idea for the Children's Museum. For the ""First Annual Celebrity Art Auction"" we solicited 100 of the state's leading citizens, asking each to create a ""work-of-art"" to auction off for the benefit of the museum. The response has been exciting, even from those who protest that they have not talents. The project netted $5,000 and much needed publicity for the museum.Another event indicative of the state's growing interest in cultural expansion is Spree, an annual three-day summer arts festival in the parks. Spree, also sponsored by the First of Denver, other banks and Colorado corporations, provides a showcase for the arts and cultural environment in Colorado. From its inception in 1974, this celebration of the arts has helped to increase public awareness of the breadth and depth of Colorado's art resources by featuring the highest levels of professionalism in the visual, performing and communication arts.And Denver is expanding its cultural offerings with the addition of such unusual events as the Denver International Film Festival, sponsored by the First of Denver. The film festival, held for the first time in 1978, was second in scope only to the annual Los Angeles film festival and presented more than 90 contemporary and classic films. The Denver International Film Festival is the only major film festival in the country known to have made a profit in its first year. When first-year profit insures a second event, profit's no longer a dirty word, is it?The First of Denver, located in the heart of downtown Denver, also provides weekday entertainment for the working world. The bank-sponsored summer concert series, held outdoors on the Plaza, has become the favorite form of lunch-hour relaxation for many downtown employees. In addition to the various forms of musical entertainment, the First of Denver also is host for special Plaza displays as well as indoor displays featuring artists from across the country, photography, sculpture and a variety of other art forms.More and more men and women in business have come to recognize that our system itself can flourish only in a society that provides rich sources of innovation, change and vitality. One of the richest for all three is the arts. The arts, more than any other form of human expression, help our society to be both affluent and humane.The Art Museum in Denver has a line (that I also like to use on my board) that sums it all up: ""You've gotta have art."""
Small Institutions Can Survive the Next 5 Years with On-Line Electronic Devices,The American Banker,"June 26, 1979, Tuesday","My horizon for future regulatory trends is five years: through the end of 1984, though I will concede that real foresight beyond lunch today is hard to find!Regulation is a part of our thrift and banking system. It does respond to needs as represented in the marketplace -- to the desires and demands of businesses and consumers for credit and financial services. Thus, my topic necessarily calls for some outline of these needs at the outset.We have now entered a kind of an explosion of credit demand that will probably continue for a few years. We expect five million new households to form by 1984, 290,000 of these in New England. The baby boom of the late 1940s and 1950s has produced a new population bulge in young families entering their age 30s, and now having children of their own. These are the prime years for first-time home ownership and trading up in the second purchase of a new home.Another real stepup in demand comes in the changing definition of what a dwelling unit is. Young people aspire to first homes now that have floor space, built-in equipment, amenities and designs which would have seemed luxurious beyond the dreams of their parents at the same age. As we all know, this upgrading effect is a substantial reason for the rising unit costs of housing, which are not all due to inflation. Added to this, we are seeing and expect to see more two-income families, with enhanced housing purchase power.As for inflation, we will be lucky to get by this year with 9%, and then see the rate brought back down to the 6s and 5s in the five-year outlook. This is where predictors can be wildly wrong.Regardless of the inflation scenario, inflation expectations are now an artificial factor in housing demand. This is due to a perception by the public of housing as a tax shelter and a hedge against inflation.The better you do your job in the thrift industry, the more feasible it becomes for new families to become home owners, and for existing home owners to increase their stakes in their homes. People who contemplate their capability to purchase and pay for a home have ample evidence of the defensiveness of home buying against increasing tax brackets brought on by compounded inflation. They are also aware of the growing property values that we see both in urban and rural communities.This demand outlook all adds up to five busy years for your principal line of commerce: financing homes. The effort will be front line, highly visible, extremely important and greatly reviewed and politicized.Our prediction of New England home mortgages outstanding goes from a value of $50 billion at the end of 1978 to $73.3 billion at the end of 1984, even with the somewhat conservative inflation outlook that I mentioned. This is up 47%. Comparable figures for the whole United States are $880 billion up to $1.64 trillion, an increase of 86%.A political leader, whose name I have forgotten, said that war is too important to be left to the generals. I could paraphrase that and say that the politicians will find this next half decade of financing housing growth too important to be left to the thrift industry. There will be laws and regulations shaping this economic activity.However short-sighted the prediction may be, though, I do not see any new major pieces of legislation coming of the importance of the Community Reinvestment Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Consumer Credit Protection Act. Like the Civil rights Act, these are in place. They may be amended and may be interpreted more broadly by regulators.The Community Reinvestment Act and the Fair Housing Lending regulations, pursuant to several pieces of legislation, will become more comfortable as a way of life than they have been.The industry will become accustomed to the guidance in these laws that the representatives of the people in Congress gave when the acts were legislated.The Community Reinvestment Act may be viewed five years from now as one of the best things that has happened to the industry. It asked the industry to define the business it is in. It turned our thoughts toward a socially desirable activity of financing the return of our population to more urban and energy-efficient living patterns. This is beginning to happen in a big way across the United States, and not just through the efforts of home-financing institutions. Community recovery and housing finance in older communities are a far more acceptable mission than continuing to exploit and destroy some of the world's best agricultural land by changing its use to housing. This new housing is often connected by umbilical roads to industrial and commercial centers over which so much of our population proceeds to travel twice daily in a gasoline-powered commute. Orientation of the home-financing industry toward recovery and revitalization of existing communities may be shortly seen as equivalent to the holy mission of fundamental shelter that went with this industry during its first 100 years.Hopefully, some deregulation that really counts will take place in this next five years; however, don't hold your breath. If the industry were to get out ahead of the consumerist and public spokesmen and the Congressmen they influence, establishing a pre-eminent reputation for social conscience and leadership, then some of the direction that comes via legislation and regulation would be avoided. The industry, if it had the strenths to take the risks that are expected of it without resulting losses to the deposit insurance corporations, could show that it does not need regulations for safety and soundness sake. This is not likely either.Surety, social progress directions as well as safety and soundness regulations can be reduced in the face of good performance by the industry, which shows that such regulation is unnecessary. There will be well-meaning attempts to recognize and strip away nonessential regulation.In the meantime, I suggest that the best way for you to deal with regulations per se is to try to figure out what the regulators are trying to do, and then help them do it faithfully and honestly. Both law and regulation make sense at some level of their conception.But, you are entitled to and should battle regulation that is not based on common-sense experience or reasonable direction for the future which will benefit our population.One of the things that is happening right now -- a regulatory trend which I predict will widen in the next five years -- is the restructuring of savings programs. If the inflation rate were reduced, I suppose the industry could argue successfully for the status quo, with tight limitations on rate of return and the bulk of people's savings in passbook accounts. But, there is a redress going on in favor of the saver.Saving is important to capital formation, not just for housing investment. Our savings rate has declined to a new low even from levels that were consistently below those of other industrialized nations. Hopefully, as savings premiums paid for the use of money via variable savings rates and indexed savings plans are applied to the industry, there will be some recognition that the additional cost has to come from somewhere.There are two practical places that it can come from and one impractical one. The practical places are an increase in the price of the product you well, i.e., the rates on your loans, principally mortgage loans. The second is some tax offset for savers which recognizes that they are taxed when they earn money and should not be doubly taxed when they gain interest from saving it. This source, of course, has to come out of the general fund in which taxes are raised, and it is a grant from the public at large. The third source, the impractical one, is a squeeze on the industry's capital. This would be to kill the goose that lays the eggs, because there is not enough capital there to support a subsidy of the size that the increased savings rates contemplate for even a few years.I do not see any money market certificates going away, and I do see the addition of bond market certificates, i.e., longer-term variable-rate savings. We will probably see lower limits on the size of certificates in all classes and a higher percentage of certificates in savings capital.These new savings programs will be accompanied, however, by some offsetting developments, given time. Mortgage-backed securities will enable smaller local lenders to hold or increase their mortgage lending activity without the usual limits of being unable to sell loans in the secondary market. One authority thinks that within a few years there will be 15 to 20 varieties of pass-through offerings available, many designed to enable small institutions to funnel their mortgages to other financing via a pool. Securities backed by conventional mortgages are expected to expand from $1 billion now to over $30 billion by the end of 1984.In the capital accounts, there may be some reduction of regulatory capital requirements for Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.-insured institutions. However, this is really not relief, because capital is required for fundamental business reasons anyway. Net worth and insurance reserve regulations are more of a safety and soundness reflection of some minimums which, though they should not be chiseled in stone, are down about as far as they ought to go.The best news is that there will be gains for alternative mortgage instruments. Federal savings and loans that do not have variable-rate mortgage powers will get them, and both federal- and state-chartered thrift institutions with such powers will find increasing public acceptance of several types of alternative mortgage instruments. Mortgage loan rates will have to go up, and they will go up. It will take a while, and it will be uphill, but even the consumerists over this next few years will come to recognize that higher premiums to savers probably have to come from increased costs to borrowers.Consumer loans and transaction accounts are not news in this part of the country while negotiable order of withdrawal accounts in all the New England states have been in effect since 1974, and state-chartered institutions have had consumer loan powers of one kind or another all along. But, like alternative mortgage instruments, increasing recognition of these powers as part of the thrift institutions' mission will increase the capability of the savings and loan or savings bank to attract the public, cross-sell and, at the same time, perform the basic service of home finance at a spread that can finance operations.There is a more sophisticated pattern of banking in sight on both sides of the ledger. Thrift institutions can be helped by the Federal Home Loan Banks and the secondary markets and by the financial industry that serves the banks. The industry will look for wider service and a more aggressive and effective pattern of serving the personal and family market. This will be accompanied by regulatory change removing barriers that tend to hold the home-finance industry subservient to the simple formulas of the past. There is a trend of recognition by the industry, and the public as well, that a thrift institution can be a full-service financial institution serving personal and family needs.New England savings and loans will grow over the next five years from a present average asset size of $83 million to a new average of almost $170 million. During this same time the numbers of savings and loans will shrink because of mergers and liquidations from the current 118 to approximately 97. I use savings and loans here to include all FSLIC-insured thrift institutions.The same general size trends of growth in size of unit and fewer institutions will take place in the other categories of thrift institutions not insured by the FSLIC.While this size growth, part of which is fueled by inflation, takes place, there will be a tendency to increase the number of offices per institution. For savings and loans this figure will go from the present 3.5 average per institution to 4.8 in 1984. During the same period commercial banks will increase from seven to 8.1 offices per bank.The five-year outlook is certainly for intense competition, especially in New England where the number of depository institutions per capita is higher than it is anyplace else in the United States. Some regulators say New England is already ""overbanked,""-and it will continue to be.Notwithstanding the competitive problems of the thrift industry, we expect that the commercial bank market share will decline from 25.5% of personal deposits at the present time to 22.2% of deposits by the end of 1984. The principal beneficiaries of this shift will be savings and loans, increasing in market share from 17.6% to 17.9% and savings banks, increasing from 56.9% to 59.8% of deposits.The total asset growth outlook in the New England thrift industry is from $57.7 billion in 548 institutions at the end of 1978 to $95 billion in 482 institutions at the end of 1984. This growth outlook includes the compounded inflation prospect that I mentioned at the outset, some 9% in 1979 coming down to 6% and 5% for the remainder of the five-year period. This idea of inflation may be entirely wrong, of course.I have a couple of other items in this tour of the horizon today. One is automated banking, or electronic funds transfer systems. EFTS was on everybody's mind five years ago. It was a matter of great interest and immediate anticipation for radical change. Then it sort of went away when the public seemed uninterested. While it has been more or less quietly off the front pages, some substantial change has taken place. Almost all thrift institutions are on-line these days, and that is electronic banking. The other marvels of the new world are around though they arrived slower than we thought they would. ""Pay by phone"" is one of the most popular of the EFT services; government recurring payments are in a swelling stream via electrical spots on tape; and so are direct deposit of pay, dividends and other corporate disbursements. Insurance company collections are going on by EFTS.I look back at our predictions made in 1975 for 1980 and find that we were not at all bad. We saw full availability of the automated clearing houses to thrifts, full third-party payments via checking and NOW accounts. Giro orderable savings and remote service unit accessed savings. We foresaw that bills would be paid through the thrift system using telephone orders, with delivery of funds through ACHs to credit payees' accounts at financial institutions. Thrift institutions would have consumer lending powers and could place loans by overdraft. They could offer national credit cards. RSUs would become commonplace.The difference, I think, in our predictions then and what has happened is that the public's appetite really was not as strong for these innovations as we thought it would be. All the capabilities are there now; the regulatory barriers have been removed for the most part; and in the next five years we will see a gradual widening of the public's confidence in its ability to use automated services and deal with you alternatively through electronic media rather than by personal visit or paper.The last item I want to talk about today in this five-year outlook is small associations' survival. Contrary to what you might deduce from some of the prospects I have outlined for you, and contrary to an impressive list of problems for a small association, I see some strength in the small thrift institution that leads me to predict that it can continue to survive and compete in this next five years.Let us turn to the problems first. The typical small association has these problems: a small earnings base which limits ability to hire and hold professional staff and management; a lack of management depth to do professional planning; inability to finance some large and more profitable loans; a small budget for innovation and startup costs of new programs; and an unfavorable economy of scale on operating costs, with some higher percentage in fixed costs than larger institutions have.On the other side, the small association can survive and compete because it has a natural fit in many market situations where the community itself is not large. The small association can, by developing the capabilities of on-line electronic banking, provide the full range of modern services and still retain the personal qualities and integration into the community that the small institution has always had.We have small savings and loans successfully on-line in this district with the full range of savings and loan services, including NOW accounts, who have less than $4 million in assets. The small thrift institution's marketable services can be increased by dealing with the same service bureaus, sharing RSUs, or using the same calculational facilities that produce these services for the large institution. The key fact is that, when the small institution in its own home-town offers the line of services and nearly the same rates available from the outsider who comes in with a branch, it can develop an advantage over the outsider.People who come in to do business will be the same people who have grown up in the town with the members of the small institution's staff and who have known the same institution for years. Loan transactions may be handled with the chief executive officer instead of an entry-level branch banker. A potential borrower's reception is better because the size of his borrowing is important to the small institution, where it might be of less consequence to a larger bank. The turnover of people is small, and everybody in the office is someone who is likely to be, if not already, the customer's friend or neighbor in the community. Special attention is easier to create; mistakes can be dealt with on a personal basis. Account analysis and the action taken pursuant to it are more personal. The individuals and officers of the small institution in the community are already members of the service clubs and community organizations over a long time and know the community thoroughly.This adds up to a quality that is being lost all to much in business in modern times, and that is personal service by your friends in your own community.So, finally, I say that, while the small institution will get bigger, it will still be small in comparison with its peers. Notwithstanding the disadvantages that will enable the small institution to survive in the next five years.Overall, I think my outlook for the period 1980-1984 is optimistic. This will be a period of great problems accompanying great change. It will also be one in which the thrift industry will respond with credit to the purposes for which it exists. This industry will be larger, stronger and more advanced at the end of the period than it was at the beginning."
Priorities at Home -- 1,The American Banker,"March 13, 1979, Tuesday","There was a time when banking was less complex and the correspondent bankers had to offer mainly a bendable elbow and an open wallet. Entertaining the respondent banker was a prime requirement of the job. Checks cleared automatically, and the correspondent as he traveled just had to ""personify"" the bank he worked for, so that no other bank could come in and steal the business. So long as it was ""Old Joe's bank"" that was processing checks rather than the ""First National,"" it was far more unlikely that the account would be switched.But ""Old Joe"" has to offer a lot more these days. The correspondent banker must be an expert on a vast number of issues of concern to the banking industry. He must understand EFTS, ATS, POS, IRA, CRA, RESPA and a whole host of other initials in addition to understanding what is happening in national and state politics. He must also be ready willing and able to evaluate overlines on the spot and offer participations when they are desired by respondent banks in need of more credits.There is a good reason that so many correspondent bankers move up to the top of bank organizations. They have to understand every aspect of the bank, and they must also have to be fairly personable to do the calling that is their job.This combination of personality and broad knowledge is of course the basic duet of skills needed for a top banking job. And a great many respondent bankers have found the correspondent so indispensable for their bank that they have hired him away for a top job in their own organizations.In other cases, the correspondent officer has found that his own bank appreciated him more because of his travels and skills.This explains why so many correspondent officers have moved to top posts in their own banks.To be sure, this process of learning and moving up can have its drawbacks for respondents. Many officers cut their teeth traveling the circuit -- visiting the respondent banks. And on occasion some correspondent officers will admit that when they were starting and really did not know much about what banking was all about they practiced on the portfolios and problems of the correspondent banks.This problem has proved to be solvable. The good correspondent bank has provided enough supervision and training to make sure that the traveling officers knew a great deal before they went out to represent it. And the officers have also been trained to phone in if a problem is too much for them, instead of trying to be heroes out on the road who have all the answers under their hats and in their brief cases.Some community banks have thus felt that they have been victimized as training grounds for employees of their correspondents. But others have found that they have been served by carefully developed teams of both experienced and unskilled people.In any event, the procedure does work. Complaints about correspondent service and the quality of traveling officers are few.Now, new demands are being placed on traveling officers. They need to know far more about personal finance than in the past. As Don C. Kramp, vice president and head of correspondent banking for First Wisconsin National Bank of Milwaukee recently pointed out in a taped interview, correspondent bankers increasingly are finding that the community banker wants help on his own financial planning and investments.This makes a whole new area of expertise for people who go out and represent banks. And as another editorial will try to show, it makes the job of correspondent banker quite different from what it has been even with the changes of the recent past."
Toledo Group Files CRA Test,The American Banker,"February 5, 1979, Monday","The challenge put forward this month by the Greater Toledo Housing Coalition is directed at the $389.7 million deposit Ohio citizens Trust Co., Toledo's third largest bank.The housing coalition, which said it represents 17 Toledo homeowner and public-interest organizations, has accused Ohio Citizens of failing to serve credit needs of low-and moderate-income families in Toledo, ""particularly in black neighborhoods.""""Data provided by Ohio Citizens under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975 show a great disparity in where they have made loans, concentrating in suburban and all white areas of the city,"" a coalition spokesman said.The coalition, which filed a letter of protest earlier this month with the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, seeks to block Ohio Citizens' proposed acquisition of the $27.9 million-deposit Peoples State Bank, Wauseon.Ohio Citizens said in November that under the new branching law it would merge the Wauseon bank into the Toledo bank, converting Peoples State into a branch.Under Ohio's new branching law, which took effect Jan. 2, banks for the first time can branch into contiguous counties. Ohio Citizens of Toledo is in Lucas County and Wauseon, a community of 5,000, is in adjacent Fulton County.Harry W. Huning, vice president of the Cleveland Fed, said the Greater Toledo complaint on Ohio Citizens' merger bid would be ""taken into consideration"" in accordance with provisions of CRA.He said the objection would be ""researched and the allegations investigated"" by the Cleveland Fed's examiner staff.The Ohio branching law contains a provision requiring banks expanding under the statute to meet CRA requirements regarding nondiscriminatory ""lending practices,"" but Ohio Superintendent of Banks R. Hal Nichols said the statute, according to an attorney general's opinion, does not apply to branching by merger.The CRA section of the law applies only to banks which seek to branch de novo into contiguous counties, according to Mr. Nichols who was given a copy of the Greater Toledo letter to the Cleveland Fed.Jean Peterman, project coordinator of the Greater Toledo coalition, said the organization has been drafting the complaint against Ohio Citizens for some weeks.The coalition's letter and complaint to the Cleveland Fed was submitted by the president of the group, Leonard Coffin, a Toledo minister, and by Mrs. Peterman's husband, William A. Peterman, professor of environmental studies at Bowling Green State University.Mr. Peterman is chairman of the reinvestment committee of the coalition which was organized within the last year.Mrs. Peterman said the coalition is studying filing a possible CRA complaint against another Toledo bank, the $587 million deposit Toledo Trust Co., and its parent holding company, Northwest Ohio Bancshares, which has filed to acquire a bank in Delphos.Northwest Ohio announced last month it would file with the Cleveland Fed an application to acquire the $37.5 million-deposit Peoples National Bank of Delphos.On the Ohio Citizens complaint, a spokesman for the bank declined comment on the coalition letter, stating that the bank has been in touch with the Cleveland Fed and will ""respond to the regulatory agencies.""""You must remember this is a whole new ballgame for us and so we are waiting for the regulatory agencies to advise us on all the rules,"" Ohio Citizens spokesman said.In its complaint, the coalition charged that data obtained under the 1975 Mortgage Disclosure Act showed that Toledo's ""racially diverse neighborhoods"" did not receive a significant share of Ohio Citizens mortgage loans.""There are 37 census tracts which received no mortgage loans in 1977,"" a coalition press release said. ""Sixty-six per cent of the black population of the Toledo area lives in those tracts.""In contrast, 16 census tracts, all in suburban or outlying areas, received 50% of all mortgage loans by dollar amount."""

Lending Reforms Win Branch for Ga. S&L,The American Banker,"September 10, 1979, Monday","The FHLBB said it approved the application of DeKalb Federal Savings & Loan association, Decatur, Ga., because the S&L recently instituted new lending and affirmative marketing programs. The approval is conditional, however, on a continuation of the new measures.Federal agencies are instructed under the Community Reinvestment Act to consider a financial institution's past service to its lending territory whenever acting on an application to expand. An FHLBB official interviewed here said the Board was faced with the question of how much weight to five DeKalb Federal's past lending record and how much to the recent improvements.DeKalb Federal's application had been protested by Metro Fair Housing Services, a nonprofit organization in Decatur, which accused the S&L of ""a pattern of discriminating against racially integrated or mostly black neighborhoods"" based on lending records through September, 1977.Anita Miller, acting chairman of the FHLBB, said DeKalb Federal's past lending record was ""very weak."" She said the agency ""can't give them a clean bill of health in terms of past activities."" However, she said the S&L's new measures were part of a ""very honest and laudable effort"" and expressed hope that they would be effective.The new measures included the introduction of Federal Housing Administration and home improvement loan programs, as well as affirmative advertising and counseling programs, according to the FHLBB.In other action last week, the FHLBB approved an application from Transohio Financial Corp., Cleveland, to acquire a Ravenna, Ohio, S&L despite a request from the Department of Justice that the application be denied.Kenneth C. Anderson, head of the Justice Department's antitrust division for special regulated industries, said in a letter that the proposed acquisition of the County Savings and Loan Co. ""will eliminate some potential competition and will not promote deconcentration in Portage County.""FHLBB officials said at the meeting that the agency disagreed with the Justice Department because of a difference in ways of calculating market concentration. The Justice Department used a different geographic area for its analysis and did not include competition from commercial banks, the FHLBB officials said."
Small Banks Focus of BAI Quality Survey,The American Banker,"May 2, 1979, Wednesday","The BAI projects is in the same vein as the Performance Appraisal Reporting Service of Mathews & Co., Darien, Conn., and has grown out of introductory letters sent in late 1978 to more than 6,000 officers of banks with $100 million and less in assets. Those letters were answered by 1,100 bankers who are now responding to a detailed 19-page questionnaire on what outside data services they use and how they rate them.The results ""should shed light on an area where precious little comparative data exists,"" stated David Van L. Taylor, vice president and director of BAI's operations and technology group which is in charge of the project.Community banks are the focus of the survey, Mr. Taylor said, because of interest they have expressed in the past. They use data processing service companies for the largest portion of their banks' needs, and yet ""so many of these critical decisions are made in a vacuum at these smaller banks. By critical decisions I mean changes in servicer, whether to buy equipment and the like. There is nothing to compare their data against,"" Mr. Taylor said.BAI believes ""this will be the most comprehensive study ever directed specifically to this area of banking."" As with Mathews & Co.'s PARS, data processing vendors were very interested in the BAI project when it was explained last month at a National Association of Bank Servicers meeting by Mr. Taylor.The questionnaire has 38 questions and a 39th for free-form comments. Answers to the questions reveal size of bank, its characteristics and market environment, and the types of services it uses, plans to use or plans not to use. Respondents are given a chance to rate 21 ""service factors"" of their service bureaus as good, fair, poor or not available; give average monthly costs of various services, performance measurements such as response times and computer up-times; and tell what characteristics they look for in a service bureau. Then there is room for an overall rating of very good, good, fair or poor.Information on the BAI survey is available from Thomas C. Tucker of BAI's operations and technology group, Bank Administration Institute, 303 South Northwest Highway, Park Ridge, Ill. 60068."
Economic Education: A Must for Consumers,The American Banker,"July 25, 1979, Wednesday","Literacy has been defined as ""the capacity to cope with both inner and outer experience."" Typically, it is measured in terms of one's capacity to read and write and perform computation. The Three Rs used to be considered basic to everything. Today it is different.While illiteracy in the classical sense has declined almost to the vanishing point, functional illiteracy -- the failure to read or write well enough to be a productive citizen -- has been growing. As little as 50 years ago, it was enough to be able to sign one's name to be considered functionally literate. The complexities of contemporary life have expanded those requirements significantly, however. In fact, current estimates are that about 23 million American adults and perhaps 13% of the nation's 17-year-olds are functionally illiterate and unable to cope in a society whose power is largely derived from the printed word.Quality has been erased from education, despite the fact that the United States spends about 7.5% of its gross national product for this purpose. It seems today that there are too many people who put too little stock in learning and applying what is learned. This is not limited only to individuals, but applies to institutions as well.More than a decade ago, social philosopher Marshall McLuhan announced the end of the ""Gutenberg"" or ""Book-Learning"" era. McLuhan's emphasis was perhaps too strong, but in the past 10 years, we have seen a steady decline in reading.We have seen the number of people who rely on television for news increasing, while just the opposite has been happening with newspapers.Some would argue that television is the culprit or that too little attention is being paid to teaching basic skills. But to suggest that ""video valium"" or anything else is entirely to blame is simply to pass the buck.If one is to blame, all are to blame.The television medium's own Edwin Newman, in fact, has called literacy ""an indispendable tool in itself, as a fundamental human right and as a gateway to other human rights as well.""Human rights, in its most fundamental context, includes the right of a human being to have the essential ingredients to cope with this practically unmanageable world. It includes the right of every person to an education, but not necessarily to a diploma. Diplomas must be earned, not given.Each day, the public is bombarded by items in the news media on economic topics affecting their lives -- from the spiraling price of gasoline to higher property taxes and mortgage rates. These are issues that Americans must decide to either support or not support. And there are, of course, dozens of other less onerous decisions relating to finance the public must make each day.How well are we equipped to make these decisions? Even those intimately familiar with a particular financial issue sometimes fail to appreciate some of the nuances that surround it. What about those who, because of a lack of economic education, must resort to seeking the simplest of answers to the most complex of questions?There is a sense of bewildernment and frustration with the economic process. In today's complex world of business and government, this is understandable. But the embarrassing truth is that too great a percentage of the populace does not understand even the most basic elements of this process.Beyond that group of unfortunate individuals whose basic literacy skills are not even sufficient to allow them to properly fill out an employment application form, or file a tax return or make change from a $10 bill, there are others who do not understand that institutions, such as banking, channel the savings of society into productive use -- that profits are reinvested in job-creating machinery -- that dividends paid to stockholders often find their way to college endowments, scholarships, and pension benefits for our retired people.The group of people who fails to understand financial institutions is not made distinct from any other group by perimeters of income level, social class or ethnic background. It is simply a group of people whose educations in the areas of business and the economy -- whether formal or informal -- has been sadly neglected. What is more unfortunate is that this group is asked frequently to take sides on issues with implicit political, economic, and social ramifications.We live today in an activist society in which many issues are debated. Candidates cannot afford to duck the tough ones, nor can the business community. Referenda have become part of our political lexicon, and the people must make a choice. In their hands rests the future of our economic and political system. We cannot sit idly by while the uninformed and undereducated decide our fate.During the political process, business has borne the brunt of criticism; this is directly related to the low level of knowledge concerning how the economic system works. Add to this the ambivalance toward having all the facts, let alone appreciating what the facts mean, and it can be seen that we can ill afford to function without proper economic education.Thinking -- seeking knowledge and applying it in some worthwhile pursuit --seems to be old-fashioned. But, if to think is to follow, then who is to lead but the ignorant?Many of those who take sides on issues, because of their limited levels of awareness -- especially in matters of the economy and business -- are often exploited, thus pitting the general public against business in a classic ""us versus them"" confrontation.The basic economic truth is that business and the public share a large community of interests, such as the creation of more jobs, lowering taxes, cutting inflation, increasing economic growth, to name of few. Business and the public are on the same side. True, differences emerge on individual points, but there is agreement on more things than disagreement.If there is to be an ""us versus them"" confrontation -- and there are those who live off the conflict -- then it should be business and the public that join together in a common effort against government. Look at your paycheck and see how much goes for taxes. See what services you receive from them. Look at all the income that is funneling into government coffers --Only a well-informed citizenry with the proper understanding of the economic process can possibly make intelligent judgments on issues, based not on emotionalism, but facts. And that proper understanding can only come as a result of a painstaking process called learning.The question is, what can be done to help the community to better cope with the economic realities of life? The answers are not easy, but it is clear that business can and must play a greater role in helping to solve this problem. Whose basic resources are better suited to educating the economically illiterate?As early as 1949, the Joint Council on Economic Education was organized by members of the academic and business communities. The Council today supports economic education centers throughout the United States, provides publications and develops instructional material for use in our high schools and colleges.More recently, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has developed an economic education program called ""Economics for Young Americans."" Through the sponsorship of a growing number of business firms, this program has exposed an estimated 12 million secondary school students to the basics of American business.In many areas of the country, the business community and public schools have organized partnership programs that have emphasized ""real world"" exposure to the business world. Business has also sponsored economic education seminars for secondary school teachers in various areas of the country. In ever increasing numbers, state school boards and legislatures have been requiring courses in economic education.These are positive steps, but there is more to be done. The expense of eliminating functional illiteracy -- whether computed in dollars or in time and effort --this problem may be even greater. Our future is very closely linked with our economic system, and our economic system will be affected by the economic education people receive today.Raising our standards of economic education need not be limited to the functionally illiterate. Increasing the level of education is a worthwhile objective overall. Working in partnership with local communities where we live and conduct business, there is no challenge that cannot be overcome -- even the gigantic challenge of improving economic education."

NJ Bank Sponsors 'Energy Expo'; Others Hold Fairs and Seminars,The American Banker,"December 17, 1979, Monday","Forty-five local businesses and community organizations exhibited at the show, which was held in two huge circus tents covering 16,000 square feet of the bank's main office parking lot. Exhibits encompassed nearly every facet of alternative energy and conservation, including such unconventional concepts as a sailplane and sheepskin clothing. A group of chimney sweeps, complete with top hats and tails, extolled flue safety and a hydraulic log splitter took on all comers.Prizes worth more than $2,000 contributed by Expo participants were awarded during the day, with a grand prize of a $450 woodstove donated by the bank.The Expo was covered by a local station broadcast from the site. On-the-air interviews with exhibitors allowed listners unable to attend to become better versed in available technology.""We were looking for a relevent community service project, and energy seemed to be a natural,"" said Carol Shanklin, the bank's marketing director and show coordinator. ""The idea originated with Alan Bagukis, an assistant vice president, and with the assistance of DeGrosky Marketing, our ad agency, we were able to put the show together in less than 90 days,"" she continued.Virtually every merchant and visitor who was asked felt that the day was an unqualified succeess, with one woodstove supplier reporting 30 sales as a result of his exhibit.""This year's Expo was by far the most ambitious community relations project ever undertaken by the bank, and we hope to make Expo '80 an even bigger success,"" M. William Benner, president of Citizens Bank, said.Some 300 persons were in attendance at an Energy Fair conducted at the Port Jefferson office of Suburbia Federal Savings & Loan Association, Garden City, N.Y. The fair was held in connection with the Port Jefferson-Terryville Chamber of Commerce in Suburbia's parking lot.In addition to Suburdia's home improvement display, there was a electric car on exhibit manned by representatives of Long Island Lighting Co. There was also a solar home on wheels and representatives from solar heating manufacturing companies and home improvement businesses at the fair.
Business SeminarsEarlier this month, Albany Bank & Trust Co., Chicago, held an energy seminar at the bank. ""Things You Know That Just Ain't So"" was the way Jerry Cooper, public affairs coordinator for Amoco Oil Co., described his energy discussion.In his discussion, Mr. Cooper attempt to dispel myths regarding current energy supplies and costs and in turn establish the facts as seen by his firm and other industry members.The Albany seminar is one in a series of business seminars scheduled at the northwest side bank.
Liberty NB&T SeminarIn Oklahoma, over 200 energy industry leaders from five states attended the SEcond Annual Energy Seminar sponsored by the Liberty National Bank & Trust Co., Oklahoma City.A two-hour concentrated presentation featured four speakers to update those attending on marketing and political aspects of development in the industry.Liberty's philosophy and specific commitments to the energy industry were highlighted in remarks by Fred M. Moses, executive vice president of the bank.The geological and economic future of the industry as it concerns Oklahoma was discussed by William W. Talley 2d, managing partner, Resource Analysis and Management Group.Gene Torbett, managing partner, Arthur Andersen & Co., presented new accounting procedures pertaining to the energy industry.Keynote speaker was C. John Miller, Miller Brothers Oil Corp., past president of the Independent Producter Association of America, who talked about the Political Scene as it affects the Energy Industry.Mr. Miller stressed the total dependence of the nation on oil, pointing out that nuclear power, solar power or other undeveloped sources can't provide an answer to the country's needs in anything less than 15 years.He called on everyone involved in the petroleum industry to do their utmost to tell the energy story, as public understanding is necessary if legislative action is to support the industry's needs.All attending the seminar were given a 74-page booklet titled ""Energy 79"" giving the energy picture in Oklahoma, graphically and statistically, with projections often through the year 2,000. The booklet is being mailed to Liberty's correspondent banks."
Honesty on P.R.,The American Banker,"June 28, 1979, Thursday","Too often a bank has established a public relations department simply because other banks had one and it felt is should therefore have one of its own. But if no one knows what P.R. is supposed to accomplish, the results are likely to be as vague as the directive.Sometimes this may be better than what the goals actually are. Sometimes banks have utilized their public relations department as a means of glorifying the top officers of the bank.Whether this has had a positive impact on bank business or not has become an immaterial factor in the decision. For as top officers have found they have liked the limelight and wanted to become even better known as public figures, they have turned the P.R. departments to work to achieve this goal. And the result may well have been positive for them as individuals but certainly not so positive for the morale of the rest of the bank.Far superior has been the approach of the public relations departments that have been given the mission of building the stature of the entire organization from top to bottom.Such an approach has accomplished a number of goals.First it has given the entire bank an image of professionalism that has helped build the bank's posture in the community.The image has also rubbed off on traveling officers, so that when they visit customers or potential correspondents, for example, the bank's image is connected with the traveling individual.And a solid image also helps in recruiting drives in the fight to get the best new talent on board.Public relations programs also can help with relations with members of legislatures by giving them a feeling that the bank is a good corporate citizen and therefore that whatever the bank is supporting in the way of legislation should be taken seriously because the bank takes itself seriously and conducts itself in a professional manner.Public relations can also help the bank in its relationships with the investment community. Although here most P.R. people issue the warning that the investment community is fickle. What they like one day they look upon with disfavor the next. So the public relations programs may backfire.And all bankers will well accept the fact that a bank share price that stays fairly steady is far superior to one that moves rapidly up and then rapidly back down -- disillusioning investors who bought at the top and discouraging employees whose options were issued in better days of the stocks performances.Thus public relations can be a tenuous area of the bank because it is so hard to determine what the banks wants to accomplish. And if people are told to go to work but no goals are established for them to achieve, the result is bound to be dissatisfaction on all sides.But one point has to be well taken: public relations can not make the banker's image become something other than is really the case. A campaign to make the bank appear friendly may involve the spending of thousands of dollars and many man hours devoted to how to present the picture to the public. But if the customer still sees scowling tellers and loan officers who say ""the answer is 'no,' now what do you want?"" then the public relations program will be all for naught. For reality quickly pushes any publicity approach into the background.In fact, if a bank is actually the opposite of what its public relations campaign tries to picture, then the result can be worse than not having a program in the first place. For the comparison of the bank's own image of itself with the public's picture of the reality of the situation can create a negative image that no amount of effort can repair.In sum, public relations can only reflect what is really there. It can tell a story, but if the story is not genuine, then the public will accept it as just what it is -- a story.The bank CEOs who complain about their P.R. programs may find it best to start right in their own offices with the public relations plans. For unless the bank knows what it really wants to accomplish and unless these goals are realistic, all P.R. can do is waste time, effort -- and money."
Illinois Bank Cites 'Newcomer Kits' For Big Increase in Account Openings,The American Banker,"December 24, 1979, Monday","The kit contains informational inserts on bank services and community data, along with a map of Springfield. The Refer-A-CArds -- distributed to realtors, apartment complexes, and personnel offices of major businesses -- give newcomers and prospective banking customers a quick and easy way to request the kits.""In the past, we had very few referrals from realtors,"" Mr. Waldron said. ""In the first six weeks after introducing the kit to some of Springfield's major realtors, we've had 39 requests for the kit and five new accounts opened. The kit has definitely been an entry into establishing better relations with those directly involved with the market we are seeking.""The kit has also been advertized through Springfield's Homes magazine and in the classified section of the local newspaper. In all, the bank received 120 requests for the kit in the first seven weeks. Eleven percent of those who requested the kits have opened accounts.According to Mr. Waldron, this percentage has been increasing steadily and is expected to reach 20% within another month or two.""There is a lag between the time when people first request information and when they finally make their move and formalize their banking relationships,"" he explained.The bank sends a cover letter with each kit. ""If the request originates from a realtor, the realtor's name and the firm's name are mentioned in the letter. This helps solidify our good relationship with the realtors,"" Mr. Waldron said.One of the services explained in the Newcomer Kit is the bank's Easy Card System. Bank customers and noncustomers can obtain a card giving them check cashing privileges at many retail locations throughout the city. The cards also give customers access to Easyteller, First National's 24-hour automatic teller machine.The Newcomer Kit was designed and produced for First National by K.D. Stearley Advertizing, a Louisville, Ky. firm specializing in bank marketing.The firm produces maps, bank service brochures, and newcomer kits as well as other marketing tools. ""At First National, we already had a map of Springfield,"" explained Mr. Waldron, ""So we incorporated it into the kit instead of producing a new one. We also did our own research for the community data inserts.""First National plans, in the future, to expand upon the services offered to newcomers, which is a ""very important market segment,"" Mr. Waldron noted."
"BAI Surveys Finds Smaller Banks Satisfied With DP Firms, Open to New Applications",The American Banker,"October 31, 1979, Wednesday","A survey conducted earlier this year by Bank Administration Institute, the most thorough attempt so far to gauge banks' relative costs and quality judgments pertaining to purchased data processing services, found nearly three out of four community banks rating their service bureaus as ""very good"" or ""good."" Only 4% of 505 responses to the key question of ""overall service bureau rating"" went so far as to be ""poor"" grades.In total, the survey presented a picture of banks that are most concerned with efficient operations of traditional banking services, and that are considering and moving toward advanced, on-line computer applications cautiously and pragmatically. These community banks - even those with less than $20 million in assets - appear to be highly conscious of the capabilities of automation in an age when computer service costs, and even computer hardware, are more than ever within their reach.Bank Administration Institute chose the under-$100 million asset population for its ""Study of the Cost and Quality of Data Processing Services Purchased by Banks"" because these institutions are most reliant on outside computer resources. Therefore, the survey goes into greater dept within this group than perhaps any other similar project including the Federal Reserve Banks' functional cost analysis which has its own unique characteristics and tries to cover the whole Fed member population.BAI has tabulated responses to its 19-page, 38-question survey form in a 36-page book of raw data and commentary that was sent to survey participants in September. The body of data is so vast that it will take considerable time to draw accurate conclusions about the bank data processing marketplace and how it is perceived by customers in it.Thomas C. Tucker, principal systems specialist of BAI in Park Ridge, Ill., who coordinated staff of BAI and Arthur Andersen & Co. in conducting the survey, said the institute wants to hold a series of one-day seminars around the country to delve more deeply into the findings and ""achieve an exchange of information on service conditions and opportunities in the participants' areas.""Mr. Tucker said in a telephone interview that feedback from survey participants has been highly favorable. Not only is it interesting to them how their peers judge the quality of various services and how much it costs them to handle a given account or transaction, he said, ""but a lot of people told me that just filling out the questionnaire was a constructive exercise in itself, because it got them thinking in ways they have not been accustomed to.""
Satisfaction is ClearIf there is one thing that can now be said about community bank users of outside data processing services, it is that they are generally satisfied with them.Very good, the highest of the four ratings, was given by 21% of the respondents, good by 53% for a total of 74%. Fair was given by 22% and poor by 4%.Satisfaction levels varied somewhat according to type of service bureau. Although 84% of the 538 surveyed institutions purchased computer resources from either correspondent banks or independent processing companies, the 11% of banks using cooperative service bureaus - usually joint ventures which they co-own - gave the highest overall supplier ratings.Cooperative service bureaus were rated very good 30% of the time, and either very good or good 83% of the time by the 58 banks using such facilities. The combined good-very good score compared with 78% for correspondent bank data processors as dependent services as rated by 201 banks.Facilities management companies - those who are contracted to come into and run the entire computer operation - achieved only 12% very good and 38% good, but since there were only nine surveyed banks in this category, BAI refrained from making general conclusions about facilities managers specifically. Another 18 banks purchased services from the ""other"" category - non-correspondent banks, service bureaus operated by bank holding companies, or some combination of the various choices - and gave good or very good ratings 81% of the time, but again this small sample is not statistically reliable.Whether from these data it can be inferred that the closeness of joint cooperatives to their users is directly attributable to their higher level of satisfaction is something that can only be determined from further study.BAI tabulations also showed that banks with less than $20 million in assets, which comprised 118 of the 538 institutions from 44 states returning questionnaires, were slightly more satisfied with their data processing suppliers than were larger banks. The smallest institutions gave very good or good ratings 79% of the time, compared with 72% for both the 259 respondents in the $20 million-$50 million range and 161 respondents in the $50 million-$100 million range.Again, a determination that smaller banks are less exacting in their demands for computer applications and services could be made only from further examination of the data and discussions with bank officials, but it is at least plausible since smaller banks would be expected to have less need for advanced capabilities.However, such generalizations according to bank size are difficult to make. The survey found that virtually all banks purchased both demand deposit and time deposit processing applications - 98% of all banks and 96% of the under-$20 million banks in each service category.
Uses and NeedsA majority of all banks said they use the following five ""main line"" banking applications: demand deposits, time deposits, instalment loans, mortgage loans and commercial loans. For banks with less than $20 million in assets, there was a fall-off to below the 50% usage level for the latter two applications, but adding those savying they ""plan to use,"" the figures climb to 51% with mortgage loans and 54% with commercial loans.For each of 14 data processing applications, BAI gave respondents four possible answers: in use, plans to use, no plan to use, and would use if available. This enabled the institute to compile an index of the most-used, most available, and most in-demand applications.Aside from the five ""main line"" account processing services, which were at the top of the usage, availability and need rankings, a sixth creeped into fourth place on the most-used scale: the banks' own payroll processing. Sixty-four percent of banks said they purchase payroll processing for their own employees. More than 70% of banks over $20 million in assets use payroll processing, compared with only 39% of those under $20 million. This was much more in demand than payroll processing for bank customers.The five least-used applications, in ascending order of use, were found to be accounts payable, safe deposit accounting, personal trust accounting, fixed asset accounting and customer information file. Fixed asset accounting, in 11th place on the usage scale, showed 11% of banks using it and 4% planning to use it.Then there was a jump to 28% using and 16% planning touse CIF, a measure of the increasing availability of and perceived value in this customer service tool which places information on all of a customer's account relationships on an easily accessible computer file. On the need index, CIF was ranked seventh. The discrepancy between its usage rank and need rank reflects increasing demand for this function.
On-line ProgressAs it did with the computer applications, BAI listed 22 data processing services, including batch processing and various modes of on-line processing and compiled relative usage, availability and need rankings. Approximately 78% of the 538 banks said they use batch processing, more than any other service listed. This was true of 75% of banks under $20 million in assets, 80% of banks between $20 million and $50 million, and 76% of banks between $50 million and $100 million.Remote batch processing, a somewhat more advanced version of traditional batch processing that comes closer to on-line operations, was used by 3% of the smallest banks but increased to 9% and 12% in the two bigger size categories, respectively. Similarly, the percentage of banks answering that they use on-line computerized inquiry systems rose in size order from 20% at the under $20 million banks to 34% for those $20-$50 million and 50% for those over $50 million. Adding further credence to the assumption that larger banks have moved more quickly into on-line processing, on-line inquiry plus data entry was used by 14%, 29% and 35% of the banks, in ascending categories of size.The data showed net expenses for on-line services to be less than comparable batch services 22% of the time, and greater 58% of the time. Customer service with systems on-line was judged to be better 86% of the time and worse 2%, and in fact this is one of the principal arguments in favor of on-line customer information files which in themselves are not revenue producers. Asked to compare on-line to batch processing overall, 62% said on-line was better, 27% said a little better, and only 3% said on-lien was not as good.For each of the top five account processing applications, all showed 70% or more of the community banks using the batch mode except for time deposits, which had 67%.The five most-used computer services after batch processing were courier services, micrographics, magnetic ink character recognition encoding, keypunching or key entry, and automated clearing house transmission. Couriers and microfiche/film services were purchased by more than 73% of the 538 survey respondents, compared with 66% of MICR encoding, 47% for keypunching and 46% for ACH transmission. Although ACH is ranked relatively high for an electronic funds transfer service that has not been highly successful in the private sector, only 3% of banks said they plan to add this capability and 23% said they had no plan to use it. Just 7% said they would use it if need scale - and 21% had no response to this question.Automatic transfers of funds between accounts was seventh on the usage scale with 42% using it and 9% planning to use. Another 16% said they would use it if available, helping place it as high as fourth on the need scale, showing a significant demand for this service.Another service in greater demand than its 11th-place usage rank would suggest is combined statements, related to the customer information file trend. Combined statements had 20% of banks using it, 13% planning to use it and 28% saying they would use it if available, giving it a seventh-place need rank.On-line automated teller machine services were 16th on the list of 22 services in the survey, with 10% using it, 11% planning to use it, 39% saying they had no plans to use it and 19% saying they would use it if available. This was enough to move ATMs up to 12th on the need scale, but it is apparent that ATMs have not been as well received by community banks as by city banks and holding companies.The four services at the bottom of the usage list, from the bottom up, are pay-by-phone services, used by 1% and planned by 3%; point-of-sale check verification services, used by 3% and planned by 2%; point-of-sale check guarantee, same percentages as check verification; and bulk check filing, used by 6% and planned by 7%. The EFT figures confirm that telephone banking and point-of-sale services have not been as widespread in the banking industry as they might appear from an examination of the raw numbers of institutions and terminals involved - most of them are run by large banks.Bulk filing, which has crept into check processing operations slowly but surely in the 1970s, bringing with it significant operating cost reductions where retrieval problems can be solved cost-effectively, is a different story. In the BAI survey, 14% of community banks said they would use bulk filing if available, and despite its rank as only the 195h most-used service, its rank on the need scale was 14th. This is a measure of the increasing acceptability of bulk filing. With checks filed away by date paid instead of by account number, retrieval of original items during the statement month is difficult, but here community banks with the reputation of personal customer service give it a vote of confidence.
QualityThere was some correlation between what banks viewed as the most important qualities a service bureau should have, and the highest quality ratings assigned by those surveyed, which amounts to a vote of confidence in the service bureau industry. The most important service criteria, calculated by averaging banks' ratings of one to six on a scale of importance, was by far ""good, efficient daily operations."" Its average importance rating was 5.62, or very crucial, compared with a slightly less important 4.95 for confidential handling of data, 4.79 for daily resolution of problems, 4.72 for exception control reports and 4.62 for flexible interest calculation on savings accounts.In three of the five most important areas, the total of good and adequate ratings by bankers exceeded 90%. Poor was the third choice. Exception control reports, seen as the fourth most important quality area, got the highest good-adequate sum, 97%, and the second highest good vote, 61%. The highest good ranking went to confidential handling, 62%, which satisfied 96% if adequate grades are added in. Efficient daily operations placed third with 57% rating good and an additional 37% adequate.Daily problem resolution, though third in importance, was 10th on the standing of good ratings at 40%. Flexible interest calculations, fifth on the quality criteria list, was also fifth with 54% good and a total good-adequate score of 89%.THat service bureau personnel ""understand banking"" not an average importance rate of 4.48, making it ninth most important. More than six in 10 bankers said this criterion is ""very important."" About 42% of respondents rated their data processing suppliers good in this area, good enough for eighth place.Clear, detailed billing by the service bureau got an importance rating of only 3.92, meaning important but not a major factor in deciding upon a servicer. This was 17th most important of 23 criteria, but 51% of the banks rated their billing systems as good, which was sixth best.The banks were least satisfied with the continued training provided by service bureaus, with only 14% rating it good, but this was 18th on the importance scale and therefore not a major indictment of computer servicers. Special programming supplied by service bureaus was ranked 16th in importance but 22d in quality, with 15% of banks saying such services were good and 32% poor. Technical advice available from service bureaus averaged 21st in importance and 21st in number of good responses at 18%.Late delivery of reports from service bureaus plagues all users, the BAI data showed, but this is really a minor problem in terms of time lost. Ten percent of respondents said their daily reports were late two times or less per year, 15% said three or four times, 18% five or six times, 24% seven to 12 times, 14% 13 to 24 times, and 19% 25 or more times. In more than half these cases, reports were late by two hours or less; reports were said to be more than four hours late 12% of the time.Nearly half of the banks said they had outages of on-line systems numbering 25 or more per year, and 20% were in the 13-24 range, and 52% of the outages were between 16 and 60 minutes long. Response time problems ""seldom occurred"" at 45% of banks, and were ""frequent but minor"" at another 39%.
CostsThe ""bottom line"" of the survey is its cost analysis. The average cost per account is relatively uniform across bank size categories, although smaller banks may have had a slight advantage in keeping unit costs low. The few responses from facilities management employers showed these to be the most expensive, if the figures can be taken at face value, for the primary applications of demand deposit, time deposit, instalment loans, mortgage loans, commercial loans and proof and transit operations. Independent service bureaus were found to be next most expensive, followed by cooperatives and correspondent banks.BAI calculations showed it cost community banks an average 46.7 cents per month to process a demand deposit account, 12.4 cents for a time deposit account, 29.8 cents for instalment loan, 43.8 cents for mortgage loan, and 57.9 cents for commercial loan.Per transaction, the average demand deposit item cost 2.4 cents to process, the average time deposit item 1.73 cents and the average proof/transit item .9 cents.The BAI publication explaining the survey and listing its results is available free to the 538 of more than 1,000 banks which returned the questionaire by last June. Additional copies can be purchased for $15 by BAI members, and $30 by others, from Bank Administration Institute, P.O. Box 500, Park Ridge, Ill., 60068. Mr. Tucker said he welcomes comments from the banking community as to what might be covered in seminars on the cost and quality of data processing services, and where the seminars might be held."
"Recession Effects on Consumer Credit, Housing Worry Agencies, Heimann Says",The American Banker,"May 31, 1979, Thursday","The Comptroller, speaking to New York financial writers at an informal breakfast meeting, said he thought that the vulnerable or soft area in such a recession would be individual debt, whereas real estate investment trusts were the problem area in the 1974-75 recession. ""The stability of consumer debt"" is ""the outstanding problem"" now facing the regulatory agencies, he declared.Mr. Heimann said that credit-card debt is basically unsecured lending, and is at record levels. Consumers have total credit-card debt ""that they would never be given if they applied for a loan,"" he said. Several members of a family sometimes have their own credit-card debt, he observed.The Comptroller said that while the single-family home generally is the last major asset a family is willing to surrender in a recession, many individual homeowners now are speculating in the housing market. He said that ""any kind of economic slowdown will seriously affect that market.""The Comptroller noted that in California 20% of homes now are owned by single individuals and not by the traditional family unit. He questioned whether homes, currently financed with two incomes, can be maintained if one of those incomes is lost in a recession.Mr. Heimann, stating that Federal regulators are watching consumer debt carefully, said computerized surveillance data of national banks reveal which banks have reached a certain levels of consumer credit as a percentage of assets. In a few cases, when the percentage has changed significantly, examiners have gone into banks to investigate, he said. Surveillance data, which are collected regularly, can detect quickly changes in such levels and can be programed to provide information for individual banks or a peer group of banks.The Comptroller said he thought that reserves should be imposed on transaction accounts held at all deposit-taking institutions in the United States, but that reserves on time and savings accounts should be eliminated. He added he did not think reserves should be imposed on Eurocurrency deposits. He said he favored President Carter's proposal to phase out deposit-rate ceilings but said there should be a ""fixed timetable"" for this change.Discussing adequacy of capital, the Comptroller suggested no capital standard could be applied across a banking system. Adequate capital for one bank would be inadequate for another, requiring in the final analysis a judgment call by examiners and agencies, he suggested.Capital adequacy, the Comptroller said, basically is a function of the asset and liability characteristics of the individual bank, and of its management and market. Mr. Heimann noted that capital ratios were very high when about 9,000 banks failed at the time of the 1929 depression.Discussing capital, Mr. Heimann noted that of 72 cease-and-desist and administrative orders issued by his office in 1978, 40 were related to capital problems. But Mr. Heimann said it was much easier to force a bank with five shareholders to raise capital than a bank with hundreds of thousands of shareholders.Mr. Heimann testified May 23 before the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee that the ratio of equity capital to total assets for national banks had declined to 5.5% at the end of last year. ""Our concern, however,"" he added, ""is directed not at the specific yearend figure for the national banking system, but instead at the trend of individual bank capital adequacy and earnings.""The Comptroller said he is discouraging subordinated debt of less than seven years' maturity, though this is not a rigid policy. He said he is encouraging debt with maturity of 12 to 15 years or more.He sated that thrifts and commercial banks face a ""big challenge"" in the next few years, when the deposit-taking system will be substantially changed.Mr. Heimann was asked whether it is realistic for Federal regulators to rely on community groups to bring to their attention cases of failure by banks to meet credit needs of low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. He replied that that approach is reasonable in the short run when ""vigorous"" community groups are able to bring attention to a problem. One difficulty for regulators, he said, is that examiners are not yet sufficiently trained and grounded in the Community Reinvestment Act to detect failure to meet credit needs but they will have that expertise in the long run."
"Court Denies Bid by Wash. Bank Chief, Independents to Stop Branch Exchange",The American Banker,"May 31, 1979, Thursday","U.S. District Court Judge Donald Vorhees late last week ruled against the contention of Mr. Edwards and the independent bankers that the exchange of branches between Old National Bank, Spokane, and Rainier National Bank and Pacific National Bank, both of Seattle, was an illegal circumvention of state branching laws.Under Washington state law, a bank cannot establish a de novo branch in a county in which it does not have headquarters or does not already have branches in existence. It can, however, move across county lines through acquisition of an existing bank through merger or purchase.This law has effectively kept Rainier, Old National and Pacific over the years from creating a truly statewide branch network, and the exchange of the branches was clearly intended to give each of them entry into areas of the state in which they had previously not been able to do business.The banks, in making the exchange of branches, contended that under the state law they could legally gain entry into a county through the purchase of one or more branches and that the law did not require them to purchase the full corporate structure of the existing bank.Mr. Edwards and the independent bankers, who have not yet said whether they will appeal the district court decision against them, took the position that the law had been intended to allow the cross-county expansion only through the purchases of the banks themselves, not branches.The three-way exchange gave Rainier its first entry into the Spokane area, the second largest market in the state after Seattle, by acquiring offices of Old National Bank there. Pacific also got into the Spokane market through the swap, as well as into Longview, while Old National picked up branches in Tacoma and Seattle.The three banks all received approval in late January for the exchange from their primary regulator, the Comptroller of the Currency, but were almost immediately challenged by Mr. Edwards, who was quickly joined in the suit by the Community Banks of Washington.On March 5, two days before a hearing on an antitrust automatic stay provision was to be held in district court, the three banks made the exchange a fait accompli, moving their own staffs into the branches they had acquired, and slapping on makeshift signs to announce the new ownerships.At the March 7 hearings, Judge Vorhees denied the automatic stay, which had been sought under the Bank Merger Act of 1966. In what some attorneys at the time called a precedentsetting provision, he ruled that Mr. Edwards and the Community Banks, as ""private parties,"" could not invoke the act.His ruling in that hearing, however, did not dwell on the central issue of whether the three banks -- which are bound by Federal regulations to observe branching laws of the states in which they are located -- had violated state law in making the exchange. That issue was decided in last week's ruling in which Judge Vorhees upheld the banks' interpretation, rather than Mr. Edwards' view.Since the three-way exchange was made in March, both Rainier and Pacific have made additional expansionary moves.Rainier made an offer this month to merge with the $92.1 million-deposit Bank of Everett, exchanging 4.5 of its shares for each Bank of Everett share. The offer, which has been accepted by the Bank of Everett, would give Rainier 10 branches in Snohomish, a fast-growing suburban and rural county north of Seattle which has recently also been the setting for growing industrial expansion.Pacific, also this month, has made a $9 million purchase offer for the seven-branch American Commercial Bank, Spokane, giving it an even stronger presence in the eastern Washington city than the branch swap did. The offer has been accepted by the board of the $45.1 million-deposit American Commercial.In both cases, the smaller banks had spurned previous offers by Rainier and Pacific, forcing them to offer substantially higher amounts."
ABA Prepares New Ad Campaign with Emphasis on Services,The American Banker,"March 28, 1979, Wednesday","Under the changeover, to begin in May, ABA is dropping its five-year-old slogan, ""America's Banker -- Helping You Change Things for the Better."" It will convert to a market-oriented theme, ""Bank Behind the Symbol -- We've Got the Answers.""The advertising effort, approved by the ABA communications council last month in Dallas, is designed in part to counter network television commercials produced by the savings and loan and credit union industries which spotlight thrifts as paramount providers of financial services.The ABA ads will cite banking expertise in various areas as well as numerous lending, deposit, checking, trust and other services offered the public by banks. The ads will be produced for print and TV by the association's Chicago advertising agency, Leo Burnett & Co.A discussion of the new ABA campaign, scheduled to get under way with a commercial on May 15, came up this week at the first community bankers executive conference sponsored by the ABA's community bankers division and held at the Crown Center Hotel here.Responding to a complaint about frequent thrift exposure on nightly network TV news shows, Sam B. McHose, chairman of an advertising task force of the communications council, said the ABA leadership recognizes the need to put across a tougher message, one that will be more precise and stress the broad array of financial services available at banks.Mr. McHose, who also is chairman of the Nevada National Bank, lowa, said the ABA would continue its ""full-service theme"" but the ads would seek to convince viewers and readers that commercial banks have the ""answers"" to their financial needs.Mr. McHose said that although it appears thrift advertising has been effective, professional research shows a lack of awareness to the thrifts' commercials -- ""as well as to our own.""Allan F. Paro, director of advertising for the ABA in Washington, said the ABA in its May-June campaign would seek to buy time on TV news shows, altering the recent practices of concentrating on football telecasts and TV specials.Depending on media costs this spring, Mr. Paro said a slight increase in ABA's $5 million ad budget may be needed. If so, it would be considered at the spring meeting of the association leadership April 23-27 at the Greenbrier in White Sulphur Springs, W. Va.ABA officials estimated that national S&L advertising produced under auspices of the United States League of Savings Associations costs about $6 million a year.It was pointed out that a good percentage of the banking industry's advertising dollars is funneled through cooperative TV campaigns run by state bankers associations, particularly in the unit-banking states of the Midwest.Mr. McHose noted that a number of state BAs have recently come to the ABA to launch advertising campaigns tied into the new ABA theme. Among them are Maine, Louisiana, Arizona, Nevada and members of an upper Midwest cooperative.Mr. Paro, vice president of marketing for the Marriott Corp. before joining ABA six months ago, said that during a series of meetings with officers of small and large banks across the country he discovered that competition and how to deal with it are universal concerns.He said bankers he talked with continually expressed their concern about ""so many forces"" competing for the dollar.The ABA, he added, decided to position its advertising to help its membership meet this competition.Mr. Paro said that in addition to television the ABA will resume advertising in national magazines. He noted that this will be the first time that the trade group has used print in three years.Aside from advertising, the inaugural executive congress of the ABA community bankers division, attended by executives of 375 small banks, heard Leif H. Olsen, senior vice president and chairman of the economic policy committee of Citibank NA, New York, suggest banks might want to enlarge their loan portfolios now in the face of a slowing in credit demand expected later this year.Mr. Olsen cautioned the bankers to be especially wary of credit quality, avoiding loans which might turn sour during a recession.Mr. Olsen predicted that short-term rates -- 90-day commercial paper and Treasury bills -- will peak at about 12% in the third quarter and decline to a low of about 6% in 1982."
Goals of Boards on Bank-Share Yields and Prices Show Radical Differences,The American Banker,"May 1, 1979, Tuesday","For example, many bankers recognize that the price of their shares could be well above what they are today. The obvious evidence of this fact is that there is a waiting list for the shares and some potential buyers wait as much as several years to obtain their holdings. The answer to this could be simply to let the price rise so that more sales cold be induced and fewer buyers would remain. Yet the bank does not want the price to move up.In some instances the board members do not want the rise higher as they are buying in a large portion of the shares that come on the market for themselves or their families.In other instances the board members are thinking of the tax consequences of their deaths and the shift of their substantial holdings to their heirs. They want the share prices kept low, so that inheritance taxes will also be low.Finally, even though allowing shares to be traded through bank share dealers or through an annual auction would likely lead to higher prices realized by present holders as they sold, many boards fear that shares would come into the hands of people from outside the community or into unfriendly hands who might want to take over the bank. In essence, they want to control share price and share ownership just as they control bank operations, even if this penalizes present holders with share prices that are well below what the bank otherwise might reach.Thus, suggestions of means to improve share price by generating dealer interest, having an auction, or other means fall on deaf ears among leading board members. For they have not the slightest interest in having shares reach higher price levels. They like things as they are.
Dividend PolicyDividend policy is another area in which some board members think more of their own concern than of the bank's best interests.There are many banks in this country that would be better off with small dividend payments or no dividends at all. For these banks have only one way to raise capital -- retention of earnings. And every dollar that is paid out in dividends lessens the ability to build capital and thus build the bank's base for growth in deposits and loans.Yet in many of these banks, some of the board members have an entirely different attitude towards dividend policy and a simple one: they have financed their stock with loans, so the dividend must remain high enough to cover their finance costs.This helps explain why at some board meetings, the question of what can be done to improve stock performance gains little or no attention and why at others the issue of dividend policy is left undiscussed -- just so long as the present dividend remains secure.Maybe this is a price the nation has to pay for community banking and the opportunity to have banks that are small enough to be truly personal in nature. For the same modest size that brings outstanding service also means that the bank is too small for the nation's capital markets to consider it.Thus, while larger banks look at share price action as something that the market determines, many community bankers look upon it as another facet of management policy, just as lending charges, savings rates paid and hours of service are management decisions.Executives of larger banks frequently are envious. for they see no correlation between their performance and the price of their shares and they sometimes dream how nice it would be if the decisions on stock price and dividend payouts were subject to greater control.But acute bankers at smaller institutions recognize the potential for conflict of interest between the board's interests and those of smaller shareholders. And many of them are trying to steer their banks away from this control over share price to more market decision making.For they know that if they don't, sooner or later some governmental agency will, only under far less sanguine and leisurely conditions."
Fed Examiner Forecasts Fewer New Bank Laws,The American Banker,"March 29, 1979, Thursday","Addressing an American Bankers Association conference of small banks, the chief Fed examiner forecast that as a result of the complaints and the fact that supervisory agencies are finding themselves ""over-burdened,"" the amount of restrictive new banking laws will likely diminish.Despite the encouraging message, small bank executives assembled here for ABA's Community Bank Conference this week expressed unhappiness at the treatment they are getting from examiners on compliance, lamenting that excessive regulation is creating needless additional expense.Taking note of the banker complaints, Mr. Ryan predicted that the amount of new legislation is bound to ""subside for a while"" as the agencies and the banks they regulate begin adapting to three major pieces of banking legislation -- the International Banking Act of 1978, the Financial Institutions Regulatory Control Act and the Community Reinvestment Act.Mr. Ryan maintained that the ""glut of legislation"" during the last two years has also created hardships on the agencies, making it more difficult to enforce the new laws put on the books.But he said ""the word is getting across"" to the Congress and to the agencies, observing that banker complaints have escalated to ""an open revolt.""Such high feelings, he explained, were evident during ABA's National Credit Conference in Phoenix two weeks ago, where Mr. Ryan was a speaker.The Fed official made his comments here during a panel presentation on regulation at the ABA Community Bank Conference held at the Crown Center Hotel.Mr. Ryan was joined on the panel by two other regulators, John J. Early, director of supervision for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and Charles B. Hall, chief national bank examiner for the Comptroller of the Currency, who also expressed their concern over burdensome regulations.The three Federal regulators noted that beside complying with the most recent banking laws, banks are also being subjected to examiner scrutiny in the trust area, electronic data processing, and consumer regulations, in addition to the standard purview of the loan portfolio.One audience participant, Russell H. Garry, president of the $20.6 million-deposit Security Bank & Trust Co., Webster, S.D., said his bank had examiners on the premises for two straight weeks conducting a trust exam, followed by a consumer compliance exam.""I was thinking of charging the examiners for room rent,"" quipped Mr. Garry.The South Dakota banker said he felt ""smothered"" by having to meet burdensome regulations.Echoing Mr. Garry's comments was Peter A. Smith, president of the $74.3 million-deposit American National Bank of Brunswick, BA., who said his bank has had to hire three new employes just to handle compliance.He said banks should not have to shoulder this kind of cost alone.In a separate luncheon address to the gathering, Federal Reserve Board member Nancy Hays Teeters defended the Fed's position on membership, arguing that the voluntary approach as contained in defeated House bills and espoused by the ABA will cost the Treasury too much in revenue.In response to questions, the Fed's first female board member said she would personally not object to the central bank giving up its regulatory powers in exchange for universal reserves, but that such a concept might not be practical.""Where would you put all those regulations?"" she asked, arguing that the Federal Trade Commission might wind up as the ""alternative"" agency gaining those powers.She said, moreover, that transfer of the supervisory function would diminish ""the close valuable contact we have with the banks.""In her remarks, Mrs. Teeters stressed that a Fed goal is to extend uniform reserves on savings and time deposits of all financial institutions, but that concept is not politically popular. She added that the Fed does seek to provide relief to banks who have held reserves for so many years without receiving interest on them.Asked by a questioner why Fed Chairman G. William Miller does not ""go to bat"" for banks in the same way as thrift regulators, Mrs. Teeters replied that Mr. Miller does indeed support banks ""all the time,"" citing the Fed's move to place reserves on transaction accounts of thrifts.She also said U.S. Sen. William Proxmire, D., Wisc., chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, was a ""champion of small banks -- a remark which drew a roar from the audience.She responded with a laugh that it was obvious her audience did not agree with her."
Hearing Set On Ore. Branch Swap,The American Banker,"February 16, 1979, Friday","Since announcing his intention last week to go to court to halt the three-way swap of branches, Mr. Edwards has been joined in his suit by the Community Banks of Washington, and the proposed exchange has prompted introduction of three bills into the State Legislature which would change the state's branching laws.Washington's ""home office"" rule generally prohibits banks from opening a branch in a country in which another bank has its headquarters, unless it can acquire an existing bank through purchase or merger.The three-way exchange among Rainier, Pacific and Old National, which has been approved by the Comptroller of the Currency, would give each of them footholds in areas of the state where they have not previously been able to do business.However, Mr. Edwards has charged that the exchange is illegal and a circumvention, and filed for an injunction last Friday, The Community Banks of Washington, representing about 80 state-chartered and smaller national banks, filed a similar suit, and the two cases were joined.In his suit, Mr Edwards is asking Judge Morrell Sharp to either grant an injunction, or recognize a Federal statute which provides for an automatic injunction when contesting antitrust aspects of a merger transaction.One of three branching bills introduced by Rep. John Eng, D., Seattle, would end most restrictions on bank branching, allowing commercial banks to open de novo branches virtually anywhere in the state. Mr. Eng is chairman of the House Financial Institutions Committee.A second bill, introduced by Rep. Shirley Winsley R., Tacoma, would permit any bank to open branches in the state's three largest countries -- 5ing, Pierce and Spokane -- during an initial five-year period. period. During a second five-year period, branching would be permitted without restriction restriction in other metropolitan areas and after 10 years, anywhere in the state.After introducing their own bills, Reps. Eng and Winsley then agreed to cosponsor a third in behalf of both the Washington Bankers Association and the would, after an initial period of three to four years, permit unrestricted statewide branching.Legislative observers at Olympia, the state capital, saw little chance of success for any of the measures, however."
Ind. BA Fights Public Funds for S&Ls,The American Banker,"February 28, 1979, Wednesday","A bill permitting state and local subdivisions to invest excess funds in S&Ls will come up for floor action in the Indiana Senate late this week. The Senate Commerce committee gave the bill a ""do pass"" recommendation on Feb. 22 with a vote of 8 to 1.Robert Nelson, IBA's executive vice president, has already successfully led one campaign to defeat a bill that would have created a state investment board and pooled investment fund. Mr. Nelson, the only person to speak against the bill at a Senate Finance Committee hearing in January, told legislators the IBA believes local government funds should stay in local banks for use in the community. The committee rejected the bill, 8-6.Public funds are also the subject of a third bill that would permit their investment in commercial paper. While the bill has moved out of the Senate Commerce committee and is due for floor action, there is much opposition to the proposal and it is unlikely to pass. The IBA has testified that not only would public funds be taken out of the community, but additionally there would be a question of risk, since commercial paper is not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. or the Indiana Public Deposits Insurance Fund.Both Mr. Nelson and Richard McKasson, executive vice president of the Savings and Loan League of Indiana, which sponsored the S&L public funds bill, agree that since so many other states now permit public funds deposits in S&Ls, legislators see no reason not to grant the same authority in Indiana.""We're hoping we won't be the 50th state to get the funds,"" Mr. McKasson said. Indiana is one of only three states and the District of Columbia which prohibit S&Ls from qualifying for public funds.""Even if we pass the bill, and the bankers are a powerful lobby in this state, we'll still be darn lucky if we get 5% of the approximate $2.5 billion in state and local funds deposited each year,"" Mr. McKasson said.One legislator suggested that in order to assure that custodians of public funds will be unable to maneuver with banks and S&Ls for personal gain, the deposit of public funds in S&Ls should be mandatory, instead of permissive, to avoid abusive temptation."
Citibank Flatbush Project Slates Multifamily Loans,The American Banker,"April 18, 1979, Wednesday","Bank officials also disclosed results of its related Stretch mortgage plan and its commercial revitalization efforts in Flatbush. The press conference, the first about the project, was held at Erasmus Academy, part of Erasmus Hall High School in Flatbush, and was attended by neighborhood officials.Working on the project are seven Citibank officials based on a second-floor office above the bank's branch at Flatbush and Church avenues and operating with a 1979 budget of $324,000. Flatbush was chosen above 23 neighborhoods because it had good infrastructure, including transportation and school facilities and a well-functioning community organization, as well as sound housing stock and local businesses, Citibank officials said.Charlotte F. Butler, project director, said at the conference that the bank this week closed its multifamily rehab loan. This $750,000 loan, made through the city's Participation Loan Program, will be used to rehabilitate 58 units in northeast Flatbush.The bank is working on other multifamily rehab loans worth $12 million, Ms. Butler said. In the next 60 days, the bank expects to close five such loans worth $2.4 million in order to rehabilitate 150 apartment building units, she said.Citibank has succeeded in developing with the city a streamlined Participation Loan Program which will cut processing time, according to Citibank officials. Announcement of this program is expected in about two weeks.Meanwhile, the bank also made more than 150 Stretch mortgage loans worth more than $6 million in Flatbush last year, she said. Homebuyers are required to put up only 10% and have 30 years to pay; interest currently is 10.5%. The program originally was for one-and two-family loans, but recently it was expanded to three-family loans. Originally available in Flatbush and two other Brooklyn neighborhoods, it recently has been expanded to others.Richard Perry, Citibank vice president and regional business manager for Brooklyn and Staten Island, said the loss rate in the Stretch program is virtually zero. He said Stretch loans constitute 50% of the bank's mortgage volume in the 16 zip code areas where it is offered.Discussing Citibank's commercial revitalization efforts in Flatbush, Mr. Perry said the bank tried to strengthen the Flatbush Merchants Association. It lent the group about three staff members, as well as office space and meeting rooms, paid postage and some office expenses, published a newsletter which went to 700 merchants, planned a street fair and helped the group run a summer youth program last year, he said.Citibank's project staff also provided or helped obtain accounting, legal and marketing services needed by local merchants. And it has made about 65 small business loans, averaging $13,000,in Flatbush. These loans were made through Citibank's community business unit since the Flatbush project does not book loans directly, Mr. Perry said.Citibank is developing a plan to provide a pool of funds for shopfront improvements and soon will present the plan to the Board of Estimate, he said.When asked whether Citibank had made or lost ground in its attempt to reverse decline in Flatbush, Mr. Perry replied that it had ""helped to abate the downward trajectory."" The bank has helped create a stronger bond of revitalization among homeowners and merchants -- a first and most important step, he said.Mr. Perry said he thought the project would last perhaps five years, at which time the bank would either institutionalize its findings or begin another project.Ms. Butler said that Citibank's Flatbush project is unique. No other commercial bank has a paid staff working full-time strictly on the revitalization of a single neighborhood, has a field office in the neighborhood, has a project involving both housing and commercial strip rehab, and has made available virtually unlimited loan funds for creditworthy neighborhood loans, she said.The project team includes three persons working on housing rehab, one manager of economic development, a financial consultant and a marketing specialist.Focal point of the Flatbush commercial strip revitalization is the planned conversion of the vacant Loew's Kings Theater. The theater may be converted to an ice skating rink and racquetball courts, with shops, restaurants and a pedestrian mall, at a cost of $5 million to $10 million.Explaining part of the rationale for the project, Ms. Butler told the gathering that each neighborhood is a marketplace and that ""if that neighborhood marketplace is not economically healthy, our branch business will shrink.""Citibank president William I. Spencer told the gathering ""Citibank is here for what we think is the long haul."" He added that banks have to decide how much risk they can undertake and under what circumstances. ""With our community development program, we may reduce or defer our return, or both,"" he said. But ultimately the bank must return to its fundamental banking business, he said.An important criteria for selecting Flatbush for the project was the presence of ""a strong, organized community of citizens with the determination and ability to make neighborhood development work,"" Mr. Spencer said. He said the bank spent a year studying and designing the project.Mike Weiss, president of the Flatbush Development Corp., said that Citibank's presence generated a $30 million investment in Flatbush last year. Two companies, one of which is Brooklyn Union Gas, now are investing in Flatbush, he said. He said that investments in a neighborhood are the ""glue"" which keeps it together.One person, noting that many of the 115,000 residents in Flatbush live in apartment buildings, asked whether there was any plan to co-op apartments. A Citibank official said it was investigating that possibility.Edward Dunker, president of the 601 East 19th Street Tenant Association, said privately he thought Citibank should talk with tenant groups, and not only with landlords, to find out which repairs are needed in a building. He cited a case where a landlord used a loan to put on a new front door to improve the appearance of a building. What was really needed, he said, was a paint job inside."
"Atlanta, Cleveland Applications Are Latest To Be Protested Under CRA",The American Banker,"May 29, 1979, Tuesday","An application of Trust Company of Georgia, which holds Trust Company Bank in Atlanta, has been protested by the Citywide League of Neighborhoods, Atlanta. Trust Company of Georgia is seeking to acquire Fickling & Walker, Inc., a mortgage company in Macon, Ga.A Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta official said that the application has been forwarded to the Federal Reserve Board, which he said would approve or disapprove the application after taking the protest into account.The Fed official said that Citywide objected to the application on the grounds that an existing mortgage subsidiary of the trust company, Adair Mortgage Co. in Atlanta, was making very few residential mortgage loans in certain Atlanta neighborhoods and thus was in violation of CRA.The official at the Fed in Atlanta said that CRA is not applicable to a nonbanking company unless that company is owned directly by a bank. Since Adair is owned by the holding company, he said, it appears that CRA is not relevant to the application.Citywide and Metro Fair Housing Services, Atlanta, had protested an earlier application of Trust Company of Georgia but their protests were received after the application had been approved by the Federal Reserve Board on March 12, the Fed official said. The protests had been sent to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. in Atlanta and were then forwarded to the Fed, he said.The approved application was to acquire Gwinnett Commercial Bank, Lawrenceville, Ga., he said.A Metro Fair Housing official said the protests had been sent to FDIC because Metro understood the trust company had a deposit insurance application related to the bank acquisition.In addition, four applications of Cleveland Trust Co. and of its parent holding company have been protested by the Buckeye-Woodland Community Congress, Cleveland. The congress sent the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland a general letter stating it was protesting the applications.Cleveland Trust filed three applications to merge three subsidiary banks -- Columbus Trust Co., First Lorain Trust Co., Lorain, and Lakeshore Trust Co., Painesville -- into the leadbank, according to a Fed Cleveland official. The three banks thus would become branches, in conformity with an Ohil law effective last Jan. 1 permitting statewide branching by merger, he said.The fourth application was filed by the holding company, Cleve Trust Corp., Cleveland, to acquire Cincinnati Trust Co., a de novo bank, the Fed official said.The protest has been forwarded to the Fed legal staff in Washington, the Fed official said, and the legal staff is determining whether the protest is substantive. The applications were officially accepted on May 15 by the Fed in Cleveland, he said.Also, CRA is a part, though a minor one, of the objection of the Connecticut Bankers Association to an application of Citicorp to establish de novo an office of Citicorp Person-to-Person Financial Center of Conn., Inc., in Westport, Conn.A Federal Reserve Bank of New York official said that the CBA filed an objection of about 30 pages, and mentioned briefly that it thought Citicorp was in violation of CRA. Citicorp officials, he said, have said that CRA does not apply to a nonbanking acquisition by a holding company.A Federal Reserve official in Washington said the Federal Reserve Board had not made any decision yet on CBA's request for a hearing on its objections to the Citicorp application.Meanwhile, in a little-noticed development, a California savings and loan association offered to open a branch in an inner-city section of San Bernardino after its earlier branch application had been protested under CRA.The S&L, California Federal Savings & Loan Association, Los Angeles, had applied for a Laguna Hills branch when it was protested in July, 1978 by Inland Counties Legal Services in San Bernardino. The protest was withdrawn in September after the S&L offered to open the inner-city branch, according to officials at the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco.The Federal Home Loan Bank Board approved both the Laguna Hills and San Bernardino branches last October, and the San Bernardino branch was opened in March, 1979, they said.In another California situation involving CRA, Southern California Savings & Loan Association, Beverly Hills, has resubmitted a lending-marketing program which the supervisory agent of the FHLB San Francisco found acceptable, a FHLB San Francisco official said.The program lacked sufficient detail when it originally was submitted. The FHLBB required a lending-marketing program and anacceptable CRA statement as part of its approval last December of the application filed by City Investing Co. of New York to acquire and merge a California S&L.Since CRA statements were required for most financial institutions last February, Federal regulatory agencies dealing with CRA-protested applications have made one turndown -- by the FDIC on a branch application filed by the Greater New York Savings Bank, Brooklyn -- and one conditional approval (in the Southern California S&L case).There also has been an approval after A CRA protest was withdrawn following an agreement between an S&L and four community groups. Approval was granted by the FHLBB in March on an application by Community Federal Savings & Loan Association, St. Louis, to open a Kansas City branch.In a case pending before the FHLBB, First Federal Savings & Loan Association, Cleveland, recently reached an agreement with the city of Cleveland after the city itself challenged its application for a branch in Stowe, Ohio. In the agreement, First Federal set a $15 million goal for its mortgage and home improvement loans to city residents during the next two years.Also, the first CRA complaint based on financing of lien sale contracts for home improvements has been made against Home Federal Savings & Loan Association of San Diego. The CRA objection on Home's application for a new branch in La Jolla raises the question of quality rather than quantity of credit extended and says that the S&L's financing of lien sale home improvement contracts exploits the credit needs of low-income Los Angeles neighborhoods.Seven CRA-protested applications were pending before the Federal regulatory agencies in Washington about two months ago."
Ferri Role Trimmed,The American Banker,"February 1, 1979, Thursday","Mr. Ferri, who was appointed to the post in 1973, was relieved of many of his responsibilities last spring in a reorganization of the department's banking division by Mr. Caldarone. The director said at the time that he was trying to take advantage of individual talents.Some of Mr. Ferri's duties were handed to Peter Nevola, a principal bank examiner who was given a new title of chief banking administrator. Sources in the Rhode Island banking community said they view Mr. Nevola as ""the heir apparent.""Mr. Caldarone said that Mr. Ferri told him this week that he wanted to resign to find a job in the ""private sector of the financial community in this state.""The director said Mr. Ferri had completed a two-year term and had ""performed to my satisfaction.""Mr. Ferri last spring lost responsibility for making policy decisions on banking questions and also for overseeing the bank and credit union examiners. He was assigned to do special projects for Mr. Caldarone. Under R.I. law, the power of the Bnak Commissioner essentially rests with the director of business regulation.Mr. Caldarone said that he hopes to name a new Bank Commissioner within two weeks. He said he has several possible nominees in mind for the $25,000-a-year post and intends to discuss possible appointments with Gov. J. Joseph Garrahy.The director mentioned Mr. Nevola, who in effect has been acting Commissioner since spring, as one possibility.Mr. Caldarone said the new Commissioner should have had exposure to bank examination practices, training in activities of financial institutions, perhaps have attained a junior executive or executive position and should have an idea of the financial interests of both banks and consumers.He may reshuffle the duties of the Commissioner, depending on who is appointed, in order to ""take advantage of individual talents,"" he added.He said he would not rule out nominating a banker but suggested that the nominee could be someone who has been involved in public service, like Mr. Nevola.Mr. Ferri, who was originally named Commissioner under Gov. Phillip Noel in 1973, stayed on in January, 1977, when Mr. Garrahy took office and nominated Mr. Caldarone as director of business regulation, replacing Robert E. Liquori. Mr. Garrahy began his second term last month and reappointed Mr. Caldarone.Mr. ferri said his approach to regulation had been ""laissez-faire. I think financial institutions should compete in the marketplace."""
Wharton Paper Says Anti-Redlining Process May Harm Disadvantaged,The American Banker,"January 5, 1979, Friday","Jack Guttentag and Susan Wachter came to that conclusion in a paper on ""Regulation of Mortgage Lending in the Inner City,"" part of a study commissioned by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.They concluded that the anti-redlining ""machinery is badly flawed because it ignores neighborhood risks.""They said that while Congress has decreed that ""lenders be race-blind, color-blind, sex-blind, and age-blind, it has never decreed, for good reason, that they must be neighborhood-blind.""They cited such legislation as the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and the Community Reinvestment Act.Mr. Guttentag and Ms. Wachter said three ""perverse"" effects of the regulations undercut their purpose:Because it would be ""a discrimination,"" lenders can't charge higher rates or require bigger down payments on inner-city loans to compensate for higher risk. ""So they avoid such lending altogether.""""While anti-redlining regulations raise costs to all lenders, the costs are disproportionately heavy among those located close to questionable inner-city areas."" The result ""is a reduction in the profitability of office locations within or close to such areas, and consequently a reduction in the supply of credit to such areas.""Extra costs imposed on mortgage lenders by government regulations, including employee training, recordkeeping and reporting, ""must reduce the supply of mortgage credit and/or raise its price. Any decrease in the supply of mortgage credit or increase in price will come at the expense of disadvantaged groups, since they are the borrowers who are rationed at the margin.""Concerning the second effect, the study said ""avoidance of troublesome locations is perhaps the best possible method of evading the purpose of anti-redlining regulations, since lenders cannot be held to account for not lending where they have no facilities for loan processing and servicing.""Contrary to its intent, the report goes on, the CRA ""is bound to make this problem worse than better over the long run, because it substantially raises the cost of opening a new office in an inner-city area to any lender not previously represented there.""Such an office, Mr. Guttentag and Ms. Wachter said, now carriers a set of CRA obligations directed to meeting the credit needs of the community. ""Once such an office is in place, the lender will never be able to remove it."""
"Mass. Banking Deputy Quits, Blasts Gov.",The American Banker,"December 21, 1979, Friday","He also accused banking commissioner Gerald Mulligan, a King appointee, of ordering him ""to say nothing that did not reflect the governor's views"" while he was serving as Mr. Mulligan's designee on the State Consumer Council.Mr. Jackson outlined his grievances at a State House press conference a day after claiming that Gov. King, an adamant pro-business campaigner during a successful 1978 drive to unseat a more liberal incumbent, was ""soft on banking"" and reluctant to regulate the industry.Mr. Jackson, the highest-ranking black in the state banking office, claimed his aggresive efforts to communicate the consumer protection provisions of the CRA were rebuffed by Mr. Mulligan and that since then, ""The banking commission has virtually ignored the law and its purpose.""Two hours later, an obviously piqued Mr. Mulligan retorted that Mr. Jackson was seeking publicity for a planned congressional campaign and had ""deliberately distorted his employment for personal political ambitions.""""There wouldn't have been any CRA in Massachusetts if I hadn't adopted it,"" Mr. Mulligan said. The statute was implemented earlier this year by his direction. Ironically, the latest of several business vs. consumer contretemps during Gov. King's first year comes only days before Mr. Mulligan is due to rule on the state's largest saving's bank request to branch out of Boston, a prospective move challenged by consumer groups citing CRA guidelines.Some consumer activists earlier charged that Gov. King, supported strongly by business and banking interests who disliked the influence of government regulation, would actually order Mr. Mulligan to approve the branch request of the $1 billion-deposit Provident Institution for Savings. Mr. Mulligan vehemently denied that assertion again yesterday in a telephone interview.Mr. Jackson, who was appointed nine months ago and is a minister with a Harvard University background, was also responsible for overseeing the possible implementation of electronic funds transfers. He said he had been directed to focus only on what that would entail for banks and not to push for consumer protections such as same-day deposit verification for EFTS transactions.""My latitude for accomplishing anything close to public service has been severely limited,"" Mr. Jackson added. ""This can only lead me to conclude that my appointment was not made with the expectation that I would be allowed to make substantive contributions to the development of policy in this administration.""Mr. Jackson said he also had been stripped of a staff and real responsibility.Mr. Mulligan, though, said he noticed that the only communities with which Mr. Jackson had communicated about CRA were mostly affluent ones in the Congressional district where he said the former deputy would be running for a seat next year. ""I encouraged him to go out with community outreach and said we should contact some lower income communities,"" Mr. Mulligan said, explaining that the approach would be more useful for CRA purposes. He also said he had told Mr. Jackson that the kind of CRA work he had done was very suspicious.The development has left Mr. Mulligan somewhat in the corner, banking observers here felt. This was especially true since earlier this year he was severely criticized by former commissioner Carol Greenwald, who accused him of mollycoddling the industry, being ""practically invisible,"" and not assertively pursuing consumer safeguards.Mr. Mulligan, who came to his present job from the First National Bank of Boston, has privately disputed that he is favoring banking interests and insisted that he wants to make decisions based on their merits.Many veteran legislators and state officials concede that this position is almost impossible in such a highly charged political atmosphere."
Thrift Agencies Grapple with Applying CRA,The American Banker,"January 22, 1979, Monday","The Federal Home-Loan Bank Board, it was learned here last week, in late December approved a savings and loan association holding company merger application under the condition that an affirmative lending and marketing program be adopted.Meanwhile, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. made no decision on Jan. 10 when it considered a branch application from the $1.4 billion-deposit Greater New York Savings Bank and later told the mutual savings bank it wanted to conduct a CRA examination and review the its CRA statement before taking any further action.Anita Miller, member of the FHLBB, noted in an interview that the regulators' task was more difficult because they now are in an interim period. Though CRA became effective last November, the CRA statement is not required until Feb. 4 and examiners have not yet conducted CRA exams.Mrs. Miller said that one of the first cases before the FHLBB involving substantative issued involved a California S&L which had ""deficiencies in lending"" as ""noted in previous exams."" The institution had taken some corrective action, but not enough, she said.FHLBB offcials in Washington said that the application in question was submitted by City Investing Co. of New York, a holding company which applied for permission for its wholly-owned subsidiary, the $316.2 million-deposit Southern California Savings and Loan Association, Beverly Hills, to acquire First Surety Corp., including its principal subsidiary, the $143 million-asset Surety Savings and Loan Association, Burbank.The applicant also sought a merger of Southern California S&L and Surety S&L witht he surviving institution to be known as Southern California Savings and Loan Association, the officials said.Late in December, FHLBB approved the merger and holding company application. As part of its approval, it said City Investing and the surviving S&L, in [words illegible] of resolutions of both boards, shall stipulate that the surviving S&L will submit an affirmative lending and marketing program acceptable to the supervisory agent by Feb. 5, 1979.The FHLBB decision also instructed that the lending and marketing program must include specific plans, proposals and time-tables for implementation. Further, it said the board of the surviving S&L shall adopt and submit by Feb. 5 a CRA statement acceptable to the supervisory agent.FHLBB officials said a pending case with important CRA considerations is an application from the $570 million-deposit First Federal Savings and Loan Association, Toledo, Ohio. Community groups want the application approved, but with conditions attached.Mrs. Miller said that if the FHLBB has the opportunity it prefers to approve applications with conditions, rather than reject them. ""If approval with conditions will make the lending happen, we'll move in that direction,"" she said, noting that the purpose of CRA is to encourage lending.On the other hand, if the board faced a ""recalcitrant"" S&L with lending deficiencies, it likely would deny its application, she said.Mrs. Miller said that the agency was ""bending over backwards to listen hard"" to S&Ls, community gorups and other parties. In an effort to treat all sides fairly, she said, district offices try to get as much information as possible and sometimes hold public hearings.In the greater New York case, the FDIC board made no decision on the protested application of the Brooklyn-based bank at a Jan. 10 meeting. Informed regulatory sources said the FDIC's tow current directors, acting chairman John G. Heimann and William Isaac, discussed the application for an hour and had"" a hell of a time coming to grips intellectualy with how to deal with the CRA in applications.""The application was the first involving substantative CRA questions to come before the board, the sources said.Greater New York, in a Jan. 16 letter to the FDIC, requested suspension of FDIC action on its application until April 30, which it said coincides with the expiration of its option to lease the premises at its proposed branch on the upper east side of Manhattan.FDIC executive secretary Alan R. Miller replied in a Jan. 19 letter to the mutual: ""Prior to further action on the application, the board will review the board's CRA statement and will order a CRA examination to be conducted. The board will also consider any additional information then available to it.""Mr. Miller said that the application will be placed on the agenda of the last board meeting prior to April 30 and stated: ""Based on the substantial amount of information available to it, the board expressed concern about the performance of the aplicant under the CRA of 1977. As a result, the board decided to table action on the application for further consideration.""In an interview last week, Greater New York president Jerome MAron declined to comment on why the savings bank suspended its application. He said that effective Jan. 15 the bank made what he called a slight change in its mortgage policy. The mutual, which had been making conventional home mortgage loans only to depositors and lowered the required downpayment on five-to eight-family homes form 50% to 35% at 9 3 / 4% interest or to 25% at 10% interest. He said the bank's board of trustees recently approved the bank's CRA statement.Herbert Steiner, chairman of Against Investment Discrimination, a group which protested the Greater New York Application, said the changes in mortgage policy were among those the group had sought. He said the group's sole desire was to have the bank meet legitimate local credcit need.The New York state Banking Department aproved the Greater New York application on Sept. 5. A department official said that if the FDIC did not approved a bank's application previously approved by the state within a year, the bank would ask the department for an extension, which normally would be granted.The FDIC, in response to a protest to an application byt he $515.1 million-deposit Northside Savings Bank, the Bronx, has scheduled a Jan. 24 hearing in New York. Representatives of the savings bank and community groups will present oral evidence.The regulatory sources explained that CRA poses more trouble for thrifts than for commercial banks and, therefore, particularly affects thrift regulators. This is due to the fact that commercial banks consider borrowers their best customers whereas thrifts consider depositors their best customers, they said.Businesses basically place deposits in commercial banks with long-range plans of receiving loans, while individuals put money in thrifts primarily for a good return, the sources explained."
The $100 Billion Question,The American Banker,"November 13, 1979, Tuesday","If Regulation Q limits were not in place and American commercial banks had been reqquired to pay the average three-month Treasury bill rate, (7.19%) on all interest-bearing liabilities plus demand deposits, the industry would have incurred $37.8 billion more in interest expenses during 1978. The 1978 net income for all insured commercial banks was only $10.7 billion in comparison. We estimate the difference between the interest costs banks will incur in 1979 and what they would have to pay for the same funds if free money market rates applied, at $63.2 billion. Finally, if today's (Oct. 25, 1979) rates were applied (as opposed to average 1978 rates) the difference would be in excess of $100 billion.This astounding amount is being effectively transferred from commercial bank depositors to the debtor sector of our economy by government edict, and not by the will of commercial bankers. Billions more are being similarly transferred from savings and loan depositors to subsidize debtors.Commercial banking as a whole is a highly competitive business. Competition forces banks to minimize the prices they charge for services. The $10.7 billion earned by all commercial banks in 1978 amounted to only a 0.76% (less than 1%) return on average assets and only a 12.9% return to other average equity capital. These profit ratios are not only modest relative to other industries, but considered by many analysts to be inadequate to underwrite the expected pace of American economic growth in the 1980s. Clearly commercial banks are not constrained interest costs to debtors. The biggest debtor, and consequently the biggest beneficiary of this transfer, is the U.S. government itself.Realistically, the gap between free money market rates and actual bank interest expenses on deposits and liabilities cannot continue to grow or to remain as wide as it is. American savers will not long tolerate a transfer tax of $100 billion. Instead, they might rebel and change the law. They might stop saving. Or they might take their money elsewhere. Some combination of the three choices above appears nost likely.There's been lots of talk about why we must eliminate Regulation Q, but little analysis of what such a move would mean to banks and the debtor sector. This issue became more important during October, 1979, with the dramatic increase in money market interest rates. Many hope that these rates are only a temporary upswing, but don't bet your life on it.High rates may prevail for a good long time, and they may go higher. Meanwhile, the savers of America are going to withdraw their funds from their savings accounts and small-denomination certificates of deposit and put them to work at double-digit rates in money market mutuals or other alternatives to bank deposits. Today, the commercial banking industry faces a dilemma not unlike that of the Federal Reserve System in keeping members. However, commercial bankers cannot hope to pass a law forcing customers to keep their deposits in banks.Can American commercial banks pay an extra $100 billion in interest? Certainly not out of current earnings as the business is presently structured. If we enter an environment wherein banks are required to pay free money market rates on all their deposits and liabilities, rates on the earning assets will have to increase dramatically. Much higher loan rates will surely dampen the demand for credit. It is extremely unlikely that commercial banks will be able to maintain the same volume and margin by simply passing the costs on to borrowers. Most likely, there would be a sharp decline in the interest margins. This means that bankers must be prepared to fundamentally redefine exactly what their business is. More than just a ""return to the basics,"" we're talking about a basic change in how banks are going to earn profits and survive.Soon banks may no longer be primarily financial intermediaries, but rather service businesses that earn their living by providing accounting and transaction services to individuals and firms. Service revenues would supersede interest margins in importance. This would indeed be a rvolutionary development. Banks would have to totally unbundle their serices and charge for them without reference to the amount of money that is kept on deposit by the customer. If so, bankers will be forced to determine far more precisely just how much it costs to provide each and every service and insure that all are priced to yield a satisfactory return. Although the revolution we describe cannot be regarded as a certainty, it is prudent for bankers to prepare for such a contingency.There are firms in the financial world that have successfully adopted a service-revenue emphasis instead of an interest-margin approach. Bankers should note that American Express Co. earned more net income in 1978 ($307,977,000) than all but two of America's commercial banks. Without its insurance profits, American Express would still have placed in the top five earners of the commercial banking industry. Redefining the banking business can yield positive benefits in the logn run. A lot will depend, of course, on whether bankers can break out of the regulatory straitjackets they find themselves in today .Our research at BAI in connection with preparing this article has yielded some startling results about the potential impact of totally eliminating interest-rate restrictions on bank deposits and liabilities.It has long been assumed by many that big banks will be in a far beter position to compete in a free money market than small banks. Resetting the 1978 income statements of various categories of banks by applying the average 1978 three-month Treasury bill rate to all interest-bearing liabilities plus collected demand deposits indicates, however, that large money center banks would be impacted just as severely as community banks. When making our calculations, we were careful to apply much greater discounts for uncollected funds to the money center banks properly reflecting their far greater deposit turnover. (See Table 1.26, pages A-19 and A-20, lines 7 and 75 of the September, 1979, Federal Reserve Bulletin for the varying discount fractions applicable.) This finding, we believe, is almost as startling as the $100 billion gap.BAI is in possession of a comprehensive data base including every quarterly call report filed by all American commercial banks for the previous years. We use these data to offer financial analysis services to the industry through the BAI Index of Bank Performance and related reports. Our 1978 data base was used in making the following analyses.To determine the potential financial impact on four different types of commercial banks we selected three typical banks in each of the following classes: 1) very large money center banks; 2) large regional banks; 3) community banks holding between $50 million-$100 million in assets; and 4) community banks holding $10 million to $25 million in assets. All three banks selected as examples of each class were near median performers in terms of return on assets in their peer group and were geographically dispersed. In selecting community banks, urban, suburban and ruraul locations were represented to provide maximum diversification. Wh then computed the bottom-line effect of paying 7.19% on all collected deposits plus other interest-bearing liabilities for each bank and for each class of bank as a composite unit. The composite results are presented in Table 1.We believe the composite results factor out individual bank idiosyncracies and are indicative of the impact that would be felt by each class og bank if unfettered competition were allowed to prevail in the market for bank deposits and borrowings. At first glance, the resuls seem to show that the effect on the larger is relatively less adverse. This is true for the large regionals but not for the very large money center banks.The very large money center banks would have to make comparably drastic changes in the way they do business as would the small banks. On the one hand, wholesale banks have less of an interest margin to protect and, therefore, can meet the challenge of gradually rising interest costs more easily. On the other hand, if the entire business of banking is revolutionized by a large and sudden leap in interest costs, small banks might be able to restructure their operations more quickly.The purpose of this article has not been to answer the $100 billion question. If teh authors had the answer, frankly, we would not give it away. Our purpose was to vall attention to the magnitude of the problem, which we believe has been largely overlooked by other commentators. It is fine to editoralize that Regulation Q must go, but it is irresponsible not to deal with the very difficutlt corollary issue of what happens afterwards.
Calculating the Effect of Eliminating Interest Rate Restrictions on Commercial Bank Deposits and LiabilitiesFor 1978, we used industry aggregate figures found in Table 5 on page 696 of the September, 1979, Federal Reserve Bulletin, where we find average assets of all insured commercial banks amounted to $1,406 billion in 1978. Demand deposits and interest-bearing claims amounted to 26.9% and 63.3% of these total assets respectively. Turning to Table 1.26 and A18 of this same issue, we find that cash items in process of collection for all insured banks as of Sept. 30, 1978, amounted to $69,156 million while demand deposits totaled $369,030 million, a ratio of 18.74%. We adjusted demand deposits downward by 18.74% to yield a net figure of 21.9%.Average collected demand deposits than comprise approximately 21.9% of average industry assets. Adding 21.9% to 63.3%, the percentage of average assets currently funded by interest-bearing claims on banks, we come to a total of 85.2%. Multiplying 85.2% times $1,406 billion (1978 average assets of all insured commercial banks) we come to a total od $1,197.9 billion, representing the average amount of collected demand deposits and interest-bearing claims on banks in 1978. Assuming interest would be paid on demand deposits if not for Regulation Q and underlying legislation, $1,197 billion is the balance on which banks would have to pay interest. In selecting a truly prime money market rate to apply to these liabilities, we decided to use the average three-month U.S. Treasury bill rate prevalent in 1978. That rate you can find on Table 1.36, page 827 of the same issue of the Federal Reserve Bulletin. It was 7.19%. A good argument can be made that the shortterm Treasury bill rate is the minimum rate that a bank or any creditor unti in our economy would be required to pay in a free money market. Multiplying 1,197.7 billion by 7.19% yields a total interest expense of $86.13 billion for 1978 first period. This is the amount we projected would have been paid by the the commercial banking industry in 1978 can be found on page 705, Table A2 in the same Federal Reserve Bulletin. The amount was $48.34 billion. Subtracting 48.34 billion from 86.13 billion yields a difference of $37.79 billion -- or $37.8 billion after rounding.Assuming only a 10% increase in bank interest-bearing liabilities in 1979; and an increase of 35% in total interest expenses for commercial banks, we developed the following projection for 1979.A $1,317.7 billion base of interestbearing claims and collected demand deposits multiplied times 9.75% yields a projected $128.5 billion in interest expense. Adding 35% increase to the $48.34 billion paid in 1978, the interest expenses in 1979 would be $65.3 billion. The difference is $63.2 billion.The assumptions for 1979 are reasonable, because the three-month Treasury bill rate through August averaged 9.o and has escalated repidly in September and October. If anything, $9.75 7A 35.6% increase over the 1978 average 7.19 rate) is a very conservatibve estimate of the Treasury bill rate for the year. Aseets in April, 1979, for all commercial banks were up slightly more than 5% over october, 1978, and we believe a 10% increase in total deposits and interest-bearing liabilities is a reasonable assumption for all of 1979. In estimating that banks total interest expense will increase by 35% in 1979, we can point to the experience of 1978, wherein the average Treasury bill rate increase by 36% over 1977 (from 5.27% to 7.19%), average interest bearing liabilities plus demand deposits increased 12.8% and commercial bank total interest cost indrawn from the appendix sextion of the Federal Reserve Bulletin.The difference between projected bank interest costs for annualized at today's (Oct. 25, 1979) three-month Treasury bill rate and those estimated to be actually in incrred exceeds $100 billion. The Oct. 25, 1979, Chicago Sun Times financial Section reports that the yield on U.S. Treasury bills maturing Jan. 24, 1978, is 13.22%. Applying that rate of interest to the $1,317.7 billion base would yield a total interest expense of $174.2 billion for the industry. We've already estimated that the actual interest expense in 1979 will be $65.3 billion yeilding a difference of $108.9 billion. Quo vidas Q is indeed a $100 billion question. Moreover, depositors of savings and loans are not event figured into this equiation, so the amount at issue for the entire economy is even greater."
Mass. Sen. Votes Reinvestment Bill; Many Banking Measures Sidelined,The American Banker,"June 1, 1979, Friday","""We should call ourselves the Massachusetts Bankers Senate,"" complains Sen. David Lock, R., Wellesley, who is assistant minority leader and generally regarded as the most skillfull and influential orator in the legislature.So far, Mr. Locke has managed to sidetrack several important banking bills --including one requiring title attorneys to guarantee their work up to the full purchase price of a home -- and let others grudgingly pass while complaining loudly.Sen. Locke notes that of 134 bills signed into law in 1979 by new governor Edward J. King, 33, or 24.6%, dealt with banks. ""There isn't a one in the bunch the banks aren't as happy as clams over, if banks get happy,"" he said sarcastically while his colleagues smiled.In fact, added Sen. Locke, more banking legislation could be passed more quickly if there were not different laws affecting different banks, such as those which are Federally chartered and those monitored by the state.""Why don't we eliminate the artificial distinctions between banks,"" Sen. Locke suggested in his singular manner which makes colleagues unsure if he is parodying what he feels are ridiculous laws. ""We grant to all of them the same powers as their competitors. It makes no sense at all.""Sen. Robert Buell, R, Boxford, a member of the committee on banks and banking, defended the panel's work and said ""most of the bills are filed from one set of banks trying to catch up with another.""For example, he said, if cooperative banks get a legal advantage one year, savings banks and trust companies and small commercial banks invariably try to play catchup the following session.Sen. Buell also noted that banking legislation, unlike most other bills, does not have to got to the ways and means committee which deals with all act pertaining to state appropriations. ""Consequently,"" he said, ""banking bills are in here earlier.""But in two days of haranguing the Senate over the amount of time it spends on what he considers frivolous banking matters, Sen. Locke pointed to one bill as an example. That proposed legislation would let the boards of trustees of banks hold meetings anywhere in the county in which they are located without notifying the state banking commissioner.""Now how silly can you get,"" he said. ""What difference in the world does it make to the legislature where the boards meet? It's a nitpicking bill."" Mr. Locke also complained vehemently the legislation is trying to correct a bill the Senate already passed this session.Sen. Locke's seriocomic attacks broke the normally staid manner of the Senate, especially when it is considering banking bills, but he objected seriously to passing some important legislation, causing it to be temporarily postponed.Probably the most important matter set aside, says the banking committee chairman, Sen. John Brennan, D., Malden, is a bill which would require attorneys to be assigned to prospective homebuyers by banks to insure the title is clear up to the full purchase price of a home.""For example,"" he said, ""if you bought a home for $50,000 and put $10,000 down, the title now is guaranteed only up to the mortgage or $40,000,"" he explained.Sen. Brennan said the proposed change ""gives protection to the buyer."" But Sen. Locke this week succeeded in getting the bill tabled until an amendment he wants, which would simply require banks to notify homebuyers they can purchase further title work, is printed in the Senate calendar.Sen. Locke did not complain, though, when the Senate passed a stat e Community Reinvestment Act which would enable the banking commissioner to deny applications for new branches if a bank does not meet the credit needs of communities it serves.""This measure,"" explained Sen. Brennan, ""establishes that a branch denial could be based on inequitable geographic discrimination of credit applications and credit denials, a lack of participation by the bank in local community projects and evidence of discriminatory or other illegal credit practices.""Banks would be required also to file annual statements detailing how they serve neighborhoods in which they are located. The House must concur before the bill can become law.Other banking bills given near-final approval over Sen. Locke's objections this week include:Allowing branches to be established 25 miles from the headquarters of state-chartered banks, instead of the 15 now allowed.Setting 15% of demand deposit totals as the legal reserve minimum for trust companies in Boston, instead of the current 20%. This puts those companies into the same ratio with trust companies outside the state's largest city.Increasing the maximum amount of mortgage loans made by cooperative banks from $75,000 to $100,000 with a 20% down payment.Letting cooperative banks make home improvement loans up to $15,000 instead of $10,000, including the amount needed for alternate energy systems. The current law allows $2,000 above the celing for devices such as solar heating.Authorizing cooperative banks to make unsecured personal loans of up to $15,000. Currently they are limited to $9,000, and $4,500 must be secured. This puts them into the same category as savings banks."
Long Sought Electronic Banking Bills Proposed In Mass. Legislature,The American Banker,"February 13, 1979, Tuesday","One EFT bill has been filed by the $7.3 billion-deposit First National Bank of Boston, $1.1 billion-deposit State Street Bank & Trust Co., Boston, the Massachusetts Cooperative Bank League, representing savings and loan associations, and Value Exchange Corp. one of two shared EFT systems based here. Another has been filed by the Savings Banks Association of Massachusetts.The FNB Boston bill would enable all financial institutions to purchase, establish, install, operate, lease, use and share any number of manned or unmanned electronic devices to serve customer convenience.This bill would allow use of these devices for deposits, withdrawals, transfer of funds, obtaining of advances against preauthorized lines of credit, cashing of checks and payment of obligations.The SBAM bill is quite similar, except that enabling powers would be given only for savings banks. SBAM would provide for a state regulation to enforce the consumer safeguards contained in Title XX of the Federal Financial Institutions Regulatory and Interest Rate Control Act of 1978, while the FNB bill would in effect copy the Federal provisions into Massachusetts law.Still an EFT issue among bankers and consumer groups is reversibility, a concept which typically gives a consumer a right to cancel a transaction in three or seven days. EFT legislation will be discussed at a March 27 meeting in the Joint Committee on banks and Banking.Both the FNB and SBAM bills, which are among a half-dozen EFT bills which have been filed, say the electronic devices may not be used to pen new accounts or to obtain authorization of new lines of credit. Also, they say, the devices generally may not be manned by any bank employee; no limitation may be placed on the location of the devices; the devices are not branches, and sharing is not mandatory unless the Commissioner of Banks deems it necessary.The Massachusetts Bankers Association is supporting the FNB bill.Last fall the $548 million-deposit Freedom Federal Savings & Loan Association, Worcester, began offering a full range of banking services through point-of-sale terminals in supermarkets in Watertown and Somerville. The move by this S&L, a member of VEC, was expected to enhance the prospect for enabling EFT legislation.Meanwhile, priority legislation in the 1979 program of the savings banks association includes bills which would:Authorize savings banks to accept demand deposits. The bill would give savings banks limited-purpose demand deposits immediately.Authorize savings banks to accept demand deposits. The bill would give savings banks limited-purpose demand deposits immediately.Raise the lending limit for loans secured by second mortgages to $15,000 from $10,000.Extend the term of home improvement loans to 15 years and 32 days, from 10 years.Revise two provisions of law concerning corporate lending. The time period for which condition statements are required would be reduced to six months from one year, and the one-year restriction on the term of a corporate loan would be removed. Savings banks have limited power to make corporate loans. A requirement that these loans had to be backed by personal sureties or endorsements was removed last year.Reduce taxation by savings banks to reach, in 1985, the $12.54% of net income tax currently paid by commercial banks. Under the proposed formula, thrifts would pay an excise tax of 18% of net income for 1979, with the percentage declining by 1% a year through 1984.Also, the savings banks association is supporting a bill providing for a state Community Reinvestment Act and drafted by Rep. Antone S. Aguiar Jr., D., Swansea, chairman of the House Committee on Banks and Banking.The bill, applicable to all state-chartered banks, S&Ls and credit unions, would require examiners to check a bank's level of community investment and the Banking Department to consider such investment in ruling on branch applications. This bill would go further than the Federal CRA in requiring banks to disclose their efforts to ascertain credit needs in their communities as well as their current participation in programs which help to meet community needs.A state CRA also is under discussion in New York.Meantime, legislative priorities of the Massachusetts Bankers Association's 1979 include:Raising to $1,200 from $500 the balance on a credit card on which 18% annual interest may be charged.Doubling, from $10,000 to $20,000, the amount of credit life insurance a bank may offer to its customers.Raising from $10,000 to $25,000 the amount a trust company may lend for a second mortgage. National banks have no such limit.Increasing the amount of credit a bank may extend to its officers from $5,000 to $10,000 (nonmortgage) and from $30,-000 to $60,000 (mortgage).Allowing more than two signatures on joint savings accounts. Two are the current limit.Increasing from $500 to $5,000 the amount that must be reported to the Commissioner if a shortage of funds is discovered.The State BA is also supporting a plain English bill similar to a Connecticut statute on the subject."
Calif. Bills Would Have Bankers Police Lien Contracts,The American Banker,"September 11, 1979, Tuesday","Lien sale contracts, in which a lien is placed on a homeowner's property to secure financing for home improvements, came under a heavy attack in the Los Angeles area early this year and inspired a large number of bills to prevent victimization of the poor, elderly and minorities by unscrupulous contractors abusing the instruments.The publicity had also led to at least one savings and loan association having a branch application protested under the Community Reinvestment Act for its part in financing such contracts.According to critics, unsophisticated homeowners have been done out of their homes by high pressure sales tactics in home solicitation contracts, with further fraudulent or ""sharp"" practices occurring during the performance or non-performance of the work contracted for, in the foreclosure proceedings after default, with speculators allegedly conspiring to acquire the defaulted property at bargain prices.One provision of a bill which has passed and been sent to the governor for signature prohibits lenders from reassigning lien sale contracts they are financing back to the contractor, a provision legislator hope will cause lenders to ""police"" the contractor they are dealing with.Another provision of the same bill calls for any contracts with ""unconscionable"" clauses, as defined by the Uniform Commercial Credit Code, to be voidable.Provisions of other bills, which have either been approved by both houses or were close to passage without opposition, call for clearer warnings to homeowners that they are risking their property if they sign the contracts, and regulate the way in which a property can be put up for sale. The sales must now be advertised in general circulation newspapers, and the sales must be held at the time that was advertised.After the original introduction of bills prohibiting lien sale contracts outright, the California Bankers Association and other lenders persuaded lawmakers to amend the bill and ""offered its banker expertise in an attempt to solve the problems . . . without driving legitimate dealers, contractors and lenders out of the budiness,"" according toone association bulletin.According to industry sources, no banks have come under attack for financing unscrupulous contracts, and only a few savings and loan associations have been accused.In the S&L case, Home Federal Savings & Loan Association, Los Angeles, sought to open a branch and drew protests under CRA. As part of an agreement worked out with protesting community groups, Home Federal will open a laon agency office in south central Los Angeles to spur innercity lending and agreed to curb lien sale contracts in that area to avoid abuses."
Tenn. Bank Promoting Its ATMs by Showing That Money Does 'Grow on Trees',The American Banker,"September 4, 1979, Tuesday","The bank has dubbed its two automated teller machines ""the Apple Tree,"" to play on the bank's perennial use of the fruit in its advertising.""We've found you can do so many things with apples,"" said Donald E. Russell, the bank's president. ""When someone suggested 'the Apple Tree' in a contest we held to name the machines, we decided it was a natural.""When the Bank of Germantown opened four years ago, its first advertising slogan was ""We'll tempt you with better banking."" Apples were used in a variety of promotional schemes and were given away at the bank's office.After the bank opened its automated teller units last May, it adopted the slogan, ""Always ripe for pickin."" The phrase is used in the headline of a fullcolor advertisement featuring an apple tree. The ad has been appearing in community newspapers.The automated teller units, located at the bank's main office and at a grocery store near Germantown's boundary with Memphis, perform 24-hour deposit and withdrawal services, transfer funds, give balance information and accept loan payments.Customers also have the option of paying utility and telephone bills through the ATMs.""We've been taking such payments at our bank for some time,"" Mr. Russell said, ""and decided to extend the service to our ATMs. The utility and phone companies, are happy with anything that facilitates payments.""Usage has been heavy at each ATM, he said, and may be responsible in part for the bank's growth from $25 million to $30 million in deposits during the six months ending June 30.""Customer interest has been very high,"" he said. ""We received several thousand entries in our machine naming contest, and customer response has been growing ever since.""Mr. Russell said the bank is considering obtaining more Diebold ATM units and installing them in locations inside Memphis, where the bank's major competitors for Germantown customers are based.The bank is conducting market surveys to determine where the largest concentrations of its customers work in Memphis, he said.If enough customers work in the civic center, airport or some other such area in Memphis, then the bank may locate an ATM in that area.""Some Germantown residents who work in Memphis have said they like to be able to go to their bank during lunch hours and make transactions,"" he said. ""If they had a Bank of Germantown facility available, we believe they would prefer doing business with a community bank.He said his bank now holds a 35% share of the Germantown market. ""Increasing that share by 10% to 15% would be a good target for us,"" he said."
Over-Regulation of U.S. Banks Could Threaten Free Enterprise System,The American Banker,"July 25, 1979, Wednesday","Historians and economists throughout the free world agree that our unique banking system has been a major catalyst in the development of the United States as a world power.Much of the money we lend creates jobs, and I know of nothing that America needs more. But people also use banks to buy autors, to buy and furnish homes, take vacations and to look after their estates after they die. The deep involvement of full service commercial banks with the American people has been a major factor in the high quality of life in America.For example, banks in New Jersey were prime movers in the financing of the bond issue which permitted the construction of the Meadowlands Sports Complex. The banks in our state also have invested heavily in numerous public bond issues and other securities that have promoted the economic well being of New Jersey and its citizens.On top of that, we do our level best to be good citizens in every possible way, involving ourselves in the whole panorama of civic good works in the communities where we work and where we live.Yet, in recent years, there has been a growing trend to regulate banks to the point that regulation threatens to become strangulation. For one thing, it is becoming increasingly difficult to service our customers without subjecting them to the great mass of paperwork required by our regulators and legislators. Excessive regulation generates paper and expenses but no earnings. It is a very real cost that must be borne by our customers to their detriment. Is this really in the public interest, or pro-consumer? Certainly not! An understanding of the appropriate balance between effective, necessary regulation and over-regulation seems to have escaped our current regulating authorities.Another form of coercion, which is exerted by private, special interest groups in the form of extra-legal pressures is sometimes applied directly on banks, through the regulatory agencies of government.During the past dozen years the banking industry has been hand-shckled with more regulatory legislation than any other major industry.Since 1966, Congress has burdened the banks of our nation by enacting 16 major regulatory measures; that's one per session, and it doesn't take into account either the many minor regulatory laws which Congress also has passed or the endless stream of new administrative regulations which spew forth from the regulatory bodies themselves. On top of that, of course, is the web of rules and regulations which continue to flow from the state level.Regulation has been a part of the industry in the United States for more than a century. No one denies that there must be some regulation by government of money supply and circulation.But noticeable change has occured in the action of the regulatory agencies. Formerly the regulators told us what not to do. Violators were penalized and rightfully so. But now the regulators tell us what to do and how to do it. To make matters worse, the rules imposed are frequently confusing, and often conflicting.One of the most ridiculous and confusing pieces of legislation to be passed in the last few years was the Community Reinvestment Act. Congress enacted this tribute to useless lawmaking 29 months ago after limited hearings in the Senate, no hearings in the House, and almost no debate. It is a glaring example of the kind of legislation which offers nothing of substance to the consumer, while adding greatly to the cost of doing business and to the difficulties for banks in providing customers with efficient service.Basically the Community Reinvestment Act requires banks to provide loans in the market areas we serve, particularly in low and moderate income neighborhoods. The act states that we should use safe and sound banking practices in making these loans. It also requires us to broadcast the availability of loans to people in these neighborhoods and to keep records on telephone inquiries and actions taken on all applications. The additional paperwork requirement is tremendous. And a bank that does not comply faces stiff penalties.Most people never heard of the term ""redlining"" until it was invented by some consumer activist. Banks have generally made loans to anyone who could repay them. A loan is an advance which is to be repaid. The credit worthiness of the applicant has always been the primary consideration.There are long-standing and proven requirements for the granting of credit and loans. Changing the requirements is not the answer. To make loans that do not meet sound banking practices presents the very real danger of heavy losses, and then everyone gets hurt. To force us to make loans to individuals who cannot repay places a heavy burden on them, and may end up putting them in a position where they may never have a good credit standing.The Community Reinvestment Act presents a rather strange situation. We are now being told to do what we always have done, only now government has made certain that it costs us a lot more to do it.First National State Bank of New Jersey has been in existence since 1812, and we have been making loans in the communities we serve through all of 167 years. We always have made all the local loans we possibly could.And that is the policy of virtually every financial institution in the country.Loans in a bank's own market area are the safest and the cheapest to originate and service. They are the most productive from the bank's standpoint since the benefits to the borrower result in additional deposits and loans for the lender. Banks generally go out of their own market area only to attain prudent diversification in their loan portfolios or to protect their earnings when they are denied the legitimate yields that a free market would produce.The Community Reinvestment Act and the Federal and state anti-redlining statutes are expensive, non-productive and counter-productive pieces of ""big brother"" regulation. They may very well harm rather than help the disadvantaged people who are the intended beneficiaries.A recent Wharton School study entitled ""Regulation of Mortgage Lending in the Inner City"" concluded that the anti-redlining machinery is badly flawed.Such Federal legislation as the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, and Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and the Community Reinvestment Act, taken together, represent new layers of laws and regulations, the combined effect of which is to inhibit inner-city lending rather than encourage it.Another example of the overwhelming regulations faced by banks is the Financial Institutions Regulatory and Interest Rate Control Act of 1978. This piece of legislation was put in final form in the closing hours of the 95th Congress. It is the most far-reaching banking legislation passed since the depression. In addition to giving regulators more enforcement authority, it covers such matters as interlocking management relationships, changes of control of banks, ""insider"" lending and lending relationships involving correspondent banks, government access to bank records, and electronic funds transfers. There are more than 100 pages in the law, which also grants the financial regulatory agencies wide-ranging new rulemaking authority.Regulations such as the ones in that act often border on the ridiculous, and are frequently passed with little thought and much haste. Sometimes these mistakes are so glaring that they are subsequently corrected.One of the provisions of the Financial Institutions Regulatory Act of 1978 was the right to privacy. It was hurriedly repealed in March of 1979. It required banks and other lenders to send each customer in a blanket mailing a statement of his rights of recourse with respect to a Federal agency's requests for records. The cost of meeting this provision would have been approximately a billion dollars.The Financial Institutions Regulatory Act of 1978 will simply add another layer of regulations that have to be observed. They are expensive from the point of view of time, effort and costs, while having little or nothing to do with productive banking.The United States District Court recently ruled that, where national banks are concerned, certain provisions of this redundant state statute are constitutional in part and unconstitutional in part.The excessive red tape placed on banks costs billions of dollars annually. The Federal paperwork commission places the total cost of Federal paperwork to private industry at somewhere between $25 billion and $32 billion per year. The commission noted, in a recent report, that a substantial portion of this cost is unnecessary.Banking -- because of over-regulation --paperwork. Unfortunately, this burden falls more heavily on smaller banks which do not have sufficient in-house legal and accounting staffs, computerized data bases and the financial resources necessary to meet the overbearing requirement of the Federal bureaucracy for additional information.Excessive regulation works against the accumulation of capital and inhibits innovative financing by banks. It also reduces efficiency and productivity, often strangles competition, and contributes to inflation.Of deep concern to me is that most campaigns for more bank regulations by government have come from the rather small groups which have cried and shouted the loudest. Why Congress and the Federal regulators have fallen into the trap of passing measures without sufficient study in many instances completely baffles me.I cannot recall any grass roots campaigns in the communities in which First National State Bank of New Jersey operates for Reg. B or Z, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Community Reinvestment Act. Furthermore, I seriously doubt if there were any in the communities in which other banks operate. And I know of few benefits that have accrued to the consumer from these new regulations.It is almost a certainty there will be violations of these regulations because of the overwhelming complexity of the rules under which banks now operate. The few that do occur out of the billions of opportunities for violation will be played up by the press. They will be blown out of proportion and result in a sweeping condemnation of the entire banking system. Undoubtedly, some will be carried into the courts by overzealous attorneys where tremendous awards will be given to those found to have been ""damaged.""It seems to be generally accepted by the public today that the businessman, including the banker, is out to overcharge the consumer. This is a very bad rap, unproven and unjustified. Legislators and regulators, however, in a violent over-reaction to what they perceive as consumers' interest have made certain that consumer costs will increase.Some bankers would like to see a total repeal of these laws. That is commonly referred to as the zero-based regulation approach. Realistically, that is not going to happen. I would like to suggest, however, that a moratorium be declared on new banking regulations. The regulations currently in effect should be thoroughly reviewed and all of those that are not really benefiting the consumer should be eliminated. In addition, I feel piecemeal legislation -- many separate laws -- is harmful to banking and the consumer. Substantial changes should be made only when necessary and at one time.As bankers, we must have continuing communications with legislators and the regulators.We must take every opportunity to educate them on the difficulties we face as the most overregulated industry in the nation. We must speak out against those laws and regulations which benefit no one, and support those that are worthwhile. All of us can help educate our individual legislators on our industry, how it operates and serves the public. We cannot rely on others to do the job for us. The banking industry has served the country and its citizens well. We will continue to do so, but only if we can operate in a free market atmosphere. Presently the over-regulation of our industry is seriously hampering our ability to operate efficiently. This must change or we, as bankers, will face more and more regulations which will eventually destroy our free enterprise system. And if this happens, all of us -- businessmen, bankers and consumers -- will lose.Picture, Robert R. Ferguson Jr."
Conn. Lenders Accused of Arson Laxity,The American Banker,"April 24, 1979, Tuesday","William Carbone, executive director of the Connecticut Justice Commission and a member of the task force, said at a governor's news conference he hoped that financial institutions could be pursuaded to supply information to fire and police investigators on the backgrounds of holders of mortgages on buildings involved in arson.He also said he hoped state laws could be amended to delay payment of insurance and mortgage obligations in all cases of suspicious fires.Mr. Carbone charged that there is a ""lack of cooperation"" from the financial community. He called for financial institutions to inspect for housing-code violations property they mortgage and pinpoint properties that might be targets for arson.He said banks should be more sensitive to arson problems and to denying mortgages to suspicious persons.In announcing the formation of new statewide task force, Mrs. Grasso named John Eveleth of New Britain, chairman of the mortgage committee of the Connecticut Banking Association and a vice president of the New Britain National Bank, as one of the members.""The task force will develop a comprehensive state arson plan and focus on improved methods of data collection and analysis and more and better training for police and fire officials and prosecutors,"" the governor said. ""The task force will also seek to reduce the profitability of arson through proposals to revise banking and insurance practices,"" the Governor said.In an interview, Mr. Eveleth said ""we have to be very careful in the disclosure of personal financial records.""He declared the Connecticut banking industry is selective in granting mortgages and added: ""A person seeking a mortgage doesn't come into the bank with books of matches around his neck and a can of gasoline over his arm.""He added that the banking industry would cooperate with the task force.John Reardon, fire chief in New Haven, and William Porter, executive director of the State Commission on Fire Prevention and Control, are co-chairmen of the task force.The other task force members are John Downey, secretary of the State Department of Business REgulation; Hugo Masini, chief of Hartford police; Austin J. McGuigan, chief state's attorney; Lt. Col. James Rice, executive officer of the State Department of Public Safety; Anthony Flannery, director of Connecticut Fair Access to Insurance Requirements, and Edward D. Bergin, mayor of Waterbury.Also, John S. Barracato, arson consultant, Aetna Life & Casualty Co., Hartford; John G. Day, president, Insurance Association of Connecticut; Francis Hoffman, president, Connecticut Chiefs of Police Association; Clarence Darrow, president, Connecticut Fire Marshals Association, and Charles Freimuth, president of the Connecticut Fire Chiefs Association."
Texas Supreme Court Blocks Bid by Hearne Bank to Move Domicile,The American Banker,"April 23, 1979, Monday","The court's opinion reversed the decision of the State Banking Board of Oct. 18, 1976, to let the bank move from Hearne in Robertson County to College Station in Brazos County, home of Texas A&M University. The banking board approved the domicile change on a 2-1 vote, with one board member admitting he had not read the record in the case but still voted for the switch.Four banks, which has opposed the application, then filed suit in state courts to overturn the board's decision. They are Citizens Bank of Bryan, First Bank & Trust of Bryan, First National Bank of Bryan and University National Bank of College Station.The trial court set aside the banking board's decision, but the Third Court of Appeals here reversed that decision and upheld the board.In reversing the appeals court decision, the Supreme Court said the banking board limited its consideration of the domicile change application to the question of whether there was a public necessity for a new bank in College Station. In reaching its decision, said the opinion by Associate Justice Collie Steakley, the board gave no consideration to the public necessity previously found that required the chartering of First State Bank of Hearne in 1957.""A change of domicile application. . . by which approval is sought to move an existing bank from the place where it was chartered to serve to a new and different banking community invokes consideration by the board of the public necessity in both locations,"" the court held.First State Bank of Hearne had an obligation to prove its abandonment of service in Hearne would be consistent with the public necessity previously determined by the board to require the service.""It is argued in behalf of the board that while it might be agreed that in domicile change hearings there should be some standard concerning the community where the bank is currently doing business, none has been supplied by the legislature,"" Justice Steakley wrote.But, he continued, the standard is implicit in the statutory scheme of regulation.""The question is not whether the board is 'authorized' by statute to make the determination of public interest in the respects discussed above, as argued by the board; the question is whether it is the duty of the board to do so in the discharge of its statutory responsibilities in regulating the banking business in Texas,"" said the opinion.""We hold that it was; and the board not having done so here, its order must fall.""Associate Justice James G. Denton dissented from the majority and said only that he agreed with the findings of the appeals court."
Fed's Real Problem Is Political,The American Banker,"May 9, 1979, Wednesday","Member banks are not really part of the U.S. central banking system or community. This system or community is the Fed itself: a government bureau whose true members are paid civil servants. Fundamentally, a member bank is merely a central bank customer, whose business relationship with the Fed is defined in a bilateral service contract. Since the parties on both sides of the contract stand as the ultimate creators of money in this country, it is ironic that the Fed's membership contract is written entirely in barter terms. The flexibility of these terms gives rise to coincidence-of-wants problems that lie at the heart of declining trends in the percentage of commercial banks that are members and in the percentage of commercial bank assets that member banks control.Member banks undertake to meet reserve and capital requirements (including the purchase of Fed stock) and to conform to other tax-like regulatory restrictions that may be set by the Fed. In exchange, the Fed lets them display a semi-prestigious medallion in their ads and windows and it contracts to provide a series of benefits: currency, clearing, settlement, credit, safekeeping, and certification services. Over time, Fed officials may be viewed as holding a series of loosely defined put and call options on member-bank balance sheets. Member banks have options on Fed services and reserve the right to terminate the contract, although for national banks exercising this option requires a prior change in charter status and typically also in name.Although the Fed offers its services in an all-or-nothing package, competing suppliers -- national and regional correspondent banks -- are far more flexible. So flexible, in fact, that even member banks make substantial use of correspondent banks.Looked at in this way, the Fed's so-called ""membership problem"" is not a problem at all. It is merely a competitive phenomenon. The declining trend in Fed membership indicates that the Fed is being outcompeted in the market for correspondent-bank services. The Fed's real problem is political: to strengthen its political base by working out a better structure for its service contract and to get that new contract co-signed by Congress.What makes the process so painful is that the Fed must negotiate on two fronts and (though Fed negotiators seldom act as if they recognize this) in each case from a position of inherent weakness. Nonmember banks and nonbank depository institutions are prepared to lobby very hard to prevent themselves from being swept into the Fed's reserve-requirement net. Member banks keep Fed officials under constant pressure both by quitting (and threatening to quit) the system and by fighting Fed efforts to persuade Congress to subjugate them with universal reserve requirements. On its part, Congress is reluctant to take any action to help the Fed that would alienate identifiable banking and thrift lobbies. Congress sees all too clearly that the membership contract is a source of a political and economic power both for the Fed and for commercial banks. It does not want to make hard decisions either amont banks, between banks and competing financial interests, or between banks and the Federal Reserve. Nor does it want such decisions to reduce its own ability to manipulate Fed officials.Congressional hearings on the membership problem have served mainly to outline alternative ""solutions"" and to sort out the distribution of costs and benefits associated with each alternative. The principal issues are:1. Universality of Reserves: Should reserve requirements be made universal and, if so, what exemptions should apply for different classes of deposits, for different types of institutions, and for institutions of small size?2. Reporting Requirements for Exempt Institutions: How can the Fed obtain the data it needs to do a better job of controlling the monetary aggregates?3. Structure of Reserve Requirements: Should reserve requirements be lowered and simplified? On this issue, politicians fear a raid on the Treasury, while economists fret about inefficiencies caused by taxing banks and bank depositors by means of differential reserve requirements. (Unfortunately, the implicit benefits of economic efficiency have a much smaller political constituency than effects on the Treasury's explicit flow of net cash, effects which could in any case be offset by eliminating a few tax loopholes.)4. Interest on Reserves: Should explicit interest be paid on reserves and, if so, should the Fed credit it directly or should interest be disbursed indirectly by allowing banks to treat holdings of selected interest-bearing instruments as required reserves?5. Access to Fed Services: Should Fed services be priced explicitly and made available to nonmember and-or nonbank depository institutions?Since each of the five focal issues can be resolved in many ways, the assortment of legislation that has come before the House and Senate banking committees resembles a series of orders from a five-column Chinese menu. Varying the resolution of even a single issue changes the distribution of benefits and costs across financial institutions and, with it, the flow of political support and opposition within the financial community. In sharp contrast to the Fed, the complexity of interacting interests leads each of the relevant financial lobbies (big banks, small banks, correspondent banks, dealer banks, thrifts, etc.) to prefer the status quo to all but a few narrowly targeted plans. Each particular lobby is holding out for a scheme that would leave its members at least as well off as they are now, while imposing some new burden upon a few of their competitors.The Fed finds itself the only party actually pushing for change. The Fed's brain trust seems to believe that, with banking and other deposit institution lobbies divided, only the threat of an incipient crisis could move Congress to action. On the doubtful 3 premise that the growing number of nonmember banks severely threatens the Fed's ability to conduct stabilization policy, Fed officials have struggled to build a case for urgency. Because neither common sense or empirical evidence supports their argument, these efforts have made the Fed look a little foolish.As I see it, the Fed has three options. First, it can wait and hope that Congress will eventually prove sympathetic enough to its plight to reduce at least the minimum reserve requirements that the Fed can set on time and savings deposits. My research suggests that, although these requirements are only 3%, banks find them extremely burdensome. In the meantime, the Fed would become weaker and weaker as a political force. Second, it can strike a sharply more conciliatory attitude toward the banking community, making an earnest effort to negotiate with bank lobbyists sensitively and respectfully rather than magisterially. To follow this path, the Fed must accomplish two nearly impossible tasks:A. to identify individual bankers who can represent the different banking constituencies, in the sense of making commitments that will be honored;B. to keep Fed spokespersons from backsliding into imperious attitudes.The Fed's third option is to take on the Congress directly, much as it took on the Administration prior to the 1951 Accord. Fed officials could do this most effectively by exercising their disputed authority to pay direct or indirect interest on member-bank reserves. Congress will fume and the Fed chairman will probable have to sacrifice himself to quiet things down, but the institution should win, if only because Congress greatly values the option of blaming policy mistakes on an ""independent"" central bank. The Fed's fundamental membership problem is that falling membership erodes its clout. In effect, losing members steadily gerrymanders the Fed's political base. By provoking a confrontation with Congress, the Fed would openly put its autonomy and special bureaucratic privileges on the line. But the Fed's unique bureaucratic status is on the line already.Although Fed independence is intended to enable U.S. monetary policymakers to concentrate on the long-run consequences of their actions, Fed decision-making has during the last 15 years focused narrowly on short-run political concern. To minimize adverse political criticism that could encourage a legislative assault on its independence, the Fed has cooperated in building and holding together an inequitable and inefficient system of ceilings on deposit interest rates and it has conformed the thrust of its monetary policies to the destabilizing rhythms of the electoral cycle. If Fed officials want to be more than convenient scapegoats for shortsighted policies that undermine long-term economic stability, sooner or later they must come out into the open and fight.From this persective, the membership trend is akin to a minor wound sustained in an ongoing political battle.

Despite Universal Banking System German SBs Are at a Disadvantage,The American Banker,"August 1, 1979, Wednesday","The underlying idea for the establishment of saving banks in the 18th and 19th centuries, still valid in its contemporary expression as defined in ""The Principles of Savings Banks,"" was endorsed in 1966 at the International Saving Banks Congress in New York. The purpose of the savings bank is: (1) to further the benefit of the local population. (2) to offer to all sections of society, especially to small-and medium-sized businesses, the entire range of banking service, and (3) to effect an equal distribution of wealth and the evasion of financial damage for the whole population through participation in economic progress.The small customer dominates. Savings banks were founded to facilitate banking service for small private businesses which the commercial banks at the time were not prepared to render. Viewing the situation from today's vantage point, it becomes obvious that business policy in those days was not programmed for potential foreign business since the clientele was very limited: small savers and credit customers. A further criterion was bound to determine the social structure of saving banks' customers to this day: while savings banks were originally set up by initiative of the Church and personal benefactors -- some of the leading institutes in Hamburg, Bremen and Frankfurt were originated then -- the 19th century saw the establishment of savings banks by communities chiefly as public institutions. By far the largest portion of today's savings banks belong to this group.This has resulted in a significant influence by these local authorities over their business policy. Moreover, mutual business relations exist between saving banks and communities, with the saving banks being involved in the financing of municipal projects. With this clientele, there is little opportunity to accumulate substantial foreign business.The saving banks' principal orientation toward a particular target group naturally limits the scope of business in spite of the generally prevailing universal banking system. This applies not only to the credit business where banking law and statutes confine, in view of the security aspect, the scope of activities for saving banks -- but also to the depository sector; to accept saving deposits from persons who could not be classified as financially underprivileged was not without problems during the initial period.By now the situation has essentially changed for the saving banks, owing to progressive adjustment to changing economic conditions. However, without question, this does not mean that saving banks in Germany have the same opportunities of exploring business as commercial banks have always enjoyed. As regards expansion of foreign business, statutory and political reservations are raised. The trend of savings banks toward engagement in international banking for their local customers and its significance in terms of the total business has only recently come into perspective and is still viewed hesitatingly; the embarkation on foreign business is thought of as involving substantial investments in providing adequate personnel; projecting and pondering unknown risks presents the decision makers with new problems.Local saving banks are confined by their statutes to regional boundaries, i.e., the customer has to be domiciled within the statutorily defined area. Although this principle is on certain conditions flexibly applied, a regional limitation of business activities is effectively assumed in distinction to commercial banks. Exceptions can develop into customary practice without constituting statutory violations, but if these deviations are judged in the light of newly evolved norms, political as well as statutory reservations will soon manifest themselves. This can lead to procrastination of decisions and liaison with the customers could be adversely affected. The principle of regionality also signifies a decentralised saving bank system, whereas commercial banks are coordinated in supra-regional headquarters but are represented abroad by a united organization.Historical and socio-economic factors have in fact led to the origination of savings banks and promoted their present significance for the German banking system. Moreover, the maxims applied to the genesis of the savings bank, which are still effective, have also occasioned the utilisation of opportunities derivable from the universal banking system with a diversified and complex banking business, as ensued in competition with other banking institutes.The growth effected during the past ten years in some sections of the savings bank system has become evident even to outsiders. The Landesbanken have very successfully responded to the challenge presented by the business community involved in foreign trading and internationalisation, and the growing significance of foreign business within the context of their total business has crystallised as an important feature of the Landesbanken, comparable with the established commercial banks.Apart from the Landesbanken, various major savings banks have already initiated activities in international banking which have been met with great interest by the business community and are likely to gain growing significance within the next few years. These would be the savings banks of such international trading centres as Hamburg and Bremen, besides those in the commercial and industrial regions of Frankfurt, Stuttgart, cologne, Dusseldorf, etc. These institutes are equipped to offer the whole spectrum of foreign banking service.This leads to the conclusion that the savings bank organisation is divided into two groups as far as foreign business is concerned: (1) the Landesbanken already engaged in international banking, along with the internationally competent major saving banks and (2) the still larger number of savings banks which are embarking on this new dimension of banking service.Foreign business of savings banks is bound to expand, because its significance as a business sphere and as an important component in the relationship with the business community cannot be overlooked. The endeavours of the German Saving and Giro Bank Association has merited this result.There is no indication whatsoever that the Landesbanken are not determined to expand their foreign business even more energetically than they have done in the past. Presumably, foreign business will increase and the international network will be perfected. Savings banks already involved in international banking are also going to intensify their foreign engagement. Moreover, it is to be expected that an ever-increasing number of savings banks will initiate activities in this direction in view of the great potential in this sphere. A substantial part of the business community banking with savings banks conduct their international business via commercial banks; these customers with connections to major commercial banks require services for their international business. To summarise: the present standard will continue to be improved. For numerous savings banks, foreign business will constitute an additional basis for the cooperation with their clients.Foreign service of commercial banks is the response to the requirements of their customers with international business. Every institute likely to succeed in foreign banking has to comply with the standard of its competitors. When international connections are established it becomes vital to react to the requirements of the customers, finding adequate solutions to their specific problems. Flexibility and adaptability are just as important as competitive conditions. A savings bank's involvement in the foreign business of a firm not only implies the execution of foreign transactions, but also the responsibility of competent and constructive engagement in the business scope of export-oriented customers. The prerequisites to meet with this niveau have been established by the major institutes of the savings bank organisation in the recent past."
Business Hikes Ed. Contributions,The American Banker,"December 17, 1979, Monday","In comparison to 1975, when the current upturn began, the 1978 figure represents a rise of 58.9%. This is the largest three-year gain in corporate support of education since 1952-55.The increase in educational support in 1978 was associated with a boom year in company giving for all purposes. Total company contributions as reported for income tax purpose amounted to an estimated $2.070 billion. This is $370 million, or $21.8%, greater than the estimate for 1977.The banking industry contributed $10,730,4000 of the total toward education or .187%, according to the survey. Pretax net income was 5,750,400, for 1978 and total contributions by some 90 banks was $43,759,300.Corporate giving to education ranked first place in 1978, the survey said. It accounted for 37% of the giving of the 759 corporations which responded to the survey. Support for health and welfare, which until this year received the largest amount of corporate support, dropped only slightly behind, with 36.9% of all corporate giving. Small as the difference is, it may herald a trend. Support of education has been stabilized at about 37% of total gifts, while support for health and welfare has been dropping as a percentage of corporate giving, from 39.3% in 1976 to 38.3% in 1977.Unrestricted gifts to education for operating support showed a large increase, both in dollars and as a percentage of the total. They accounted for 18.5% of total educational gifts, up from 16.9% in 1977. Department and research grants also showed large dollar and percentage increases, accounting for 17.7% of the total, up from 15.4% in 1977.Gifts realized from corporate matching-gift program also continued to rise, both in dollars and as a percentage of the total, due to the increasing number of companies adopting such programs and the liberalization of the programs themselves.Funding of company sponsored foundations amounted to $419 million, an increase of 46.9% over 1977. Grants made by these foundations for all purposes totaled $278 million, up 15.2%. The difference of some $141 million between money received by the foundation and grants paid out constituted an addition to the reserves which will be available to maintain the level of corporate giving if profits should drop in the future. The three-year increase in this reserve amounts to about $700 million.The Council for Financial Aid to Education is a not-for-profit organization which promotes voluntary support of higher education from all sources, but particularly the corporate community. Among its many activities, it sponsors the national public service advertising campaign, ""Give to the college of your choice,"" through the Advertising Council. Clifton C. Garvin Jr. chairman of Exxon Corp., is chairman of CFAE."
NY Reciprocity Hit in Calif.,The American Banker,"November 26, 1979, Monday","The Californians were united in the position that the bill was a one-sided measure that favors the New York banks, which were responsible for its being introduced in this year's session of the legislature.The measure would allow non-California bank holding companies to establish up to two bank branches in California, providing their headquarters state passed similar legislation permitting California institutions to branch there. A similar measure was introduced in the New York Legislature but failed to pass this year.In interim hearings of the Assembly finance, insurance and commerce committee, New York banking representatives urged passage of the bill, claiming it would benefit consumers by enhancing competition, and would offset a competitive advantage enjoyed by foreign banks.Californians testifying in opposition to the bill, however, said the reciprocity between New York and California would be uneven.A. A. Milligan, president of the Bank of A. Levy, Oxnard, Calif., and former president of the American Bankers Association, told the committee that New York banks would likely establish their branches in San Francisco and Los Angeles, while California branches would locate in New York City. He called this a trade of ""one unattractive market for two attractive markets.""Echoing his sentiments, John Duffy, executive vice president of Security Pacific Corp., Los Angeles, told the committee that he ""wouldn't trade two blocks of Fresno for the entire city of New York.""In his testimony, Mr. Milligan charged that the measure would be detrimental to community banking in California.""Locally owned and managed banks would be replaced by bank holding companies with a greater interest in national or international lending, to the potential detriment of the local community,"" he asserted.Mr. Duffy argued that any change in interstate banking laws should be made in Congress, rather than on a piecemeal basis between states.Federal laws prohibit direct branching by banks across state lines, but permit interstate banking holding company expansion of bank branches if state law specifically permits it.New York State Bankers Association president Richard K. LeBlond 2d testified in favor of the California measure, claiming consumers would benefit.
'Crazy-Quilt'The public pays a high price for the inefficiency caused by the crazy-quilt banking system, caused by all these limitations,"" said Mr. LeBlond, who is vice chairman of Chemical Bank, New York. He called the bill ""a step toward a new national banking marketplace.""Also testifying was Fred Pownall, a San Francisco attorney representing Citicorp, New York, who told the committee that ""the benefit is competition. If other presences come to California, the consumer's going to benefit."" The interstate bill, introduced by Assemblyman Howard Berman, D., Los Angeles, is a ""two year bill."" Introduced in 1979, it must be approved by committee during the first month of the 1980 continuation of the session in January, or it will automatically die."
Banks Use Innovative Techniques to Fund Urban Redevelopment,The American Banker,"May 11, 1979, Friday","A common thread in these projects is an effort to attract young, professional singles and couples who had fled the cities for the suburbs. The housing projects are located near cities' central business districts and involve both rehabilitation of existing housing and new construction. Banks have worked closely with city governments on these projects.As they participate in large housing redevelopments, banks are becoming involved, in varying degrees, in the issue of displacement of existing residents.The $1.3 billion-deposit Mercantile Trust Co. NA, St. Louis, is financing acquisition and administrative expenses for a 106-acre redevelopment in this city through an unusual five-year revolving credit agreement with a developer. And the $3.2 billion-deposit North Carolina National Bank, Charlotte, has formed the nation's first community development corporation, which has taken title to property worth about $700,000 in the rehabilitated Fourth Ward of Charlotte.Meanwhile, the $1.5 billion-deposit First National Bank, Minneapolis, is actively backing a 2,700-unit development in that city financed by tax increment financing, a method involving an issue of city bonds to acquire land and make public improvements.The three projects were discussed at length during a recent workshop on community reinvestment techniques held here and sponsored by the American Bankers Association.
ST. LOUISMercantile Trust Co., St. Louis, is providing financing in a relatively unique way for a housing redevelopment in the city's Pershing-Waterman area. The sole developer of the area is Pantheon Corp., St. Louis, and Pantheon rubsidiaries.John J. Wuest, vice president and head of the bank's real estate division, said in interviews that to his knowledge no bank previously had been willing to finance five-year acquisition and administrative expenses, with an interest rate cap and without personal guarantees, to develop a run-down area where real estate did not have proven economic viability.The key financing tool in the St. Louis redevelopment is a five-year revolving credit agreement signed by Mercantile and Pershing Land Corp. on May 28, 1975. Pershing is a Pantheon subsidiary which acquires and holds properties in the redevelopment area until the properties are to be utilized for redevelopment.The agreement essentially provides that for every $1 Pershing Land puts up, Mercantile agrees to lend $3, to a maximum of about $3 million.Interest on advances is set at the lesser of 9% or the bank's prime rate for 90-day commercial loans.Advances have been provided, in the order of their size, for: land acquisition or obtaining options to purchase, including closing costs; interest payments to Mercantile on advances; administrative expenses; and carrying charges associated with purchase money mortgages, according to Mr. Wuest. The 14-page agreement spells out the possible uses of the advances.Banks involved in development projects have made acquisition and development loans but those are typically for an 18-month period, are not revolving, and are at about 2.5% over prime, Mr. Wuest pointed out.Mercantile has advanced about $2.5 million to Pershing, which has paid back about $350,000, Mr. Wuest said. Outstanding loans to Pershing currently are about $2.1 million, which is about as high a level as the outstandings have gone, he said. The $3 million maximum never was reached because Pershing was able to acquire land for less than the bank originally expected, he said.Mercantile's security in the revolving credit agreement lies largely in a first deed of trust, a type of mortgage which it holds on a substantial amount of land acquired, Mr. Wuest said.Pershing's equity in the $1-for-$3 arrangement consists of about $560,000 in subordinated debentures. Pantheon president Leon R. Strauss told the bankers he raised money for the debentures in $25,000 increments from about 15 parties, including friends and family.In addition to the revolving credit agreement, Mercantile has an informal agreement with Pantheon to make available permanent mortgages to purchasers of rehabilitated and new units. The bank is limiting itself to 25% of the total of permanent financing required.Other banks and savings and loan associations in St. Louis are making these mortgages, so that Mercantile has made only a half-dozen loans on some 50 condominium units which have been sold.Mercantile also stands ready to provide interim construction financing for rehabilitation and new construction, Mr. Wuest said. The bank has provided about $2.5 million of such funds, and has commitments to provide about $5 million for construction of new single-family units, he said.The bank definitely expects to extend and renegotiate its loan agreement next May, the MeRcantile vice president said. Two aspects the bank will examine will be the interest rate and accelerated payback provisions, he said.By next May, land acquisition will be 100% complete, with rehabilitation and new construction perhaps 50% completed. That is ""pretty much on schedule,"" since the bank expected about a 10-year time frame for completion of development work, he said. He added the bank was ""delighted"" with the project.He said the bank provided a fair amount of assistance on the financing of the project, but very little on the marketing aspects. Asked whether the bank helped obtain public funds -- CD block grant funds have been used to improve streets and lighting -- he said the bank had helped indirectly, since the bank's financial involvement was essential to the project's viability.He said the bank did not help put the development plans together; Mr. Strauss had a skeletal idea of the project as far back as his first meeting with Donald E. Lasater, chairman and chief executive officer of Mercantile, about six years ago.Asked what he saw as the responsibility of the bank as far as displaced residents, were concerned, Mr. Wuest said he understood the project would displace a relatively minor number of people but would create housing opportunities for many people, would create an economic base and would restore a very run-down neighborhood.He said almost all of those displaced were transients, and noted that 20% of rental units were subsidized. Those 20% were of far better quality than the original units, which had numerous housing code violations, he said. Pershing-Waterman, which consisted mostly of multifamily housing, had a high crime rate prior to development.Mr. Wuest added that banks were much more attuned to displacement now than they were five years ago. He said banks involved in development projects do have a responsibility as far as who is being displaced, where they are being sent and whether they may live in the area once it is rehabilitated. He said some original residents had received a poor deal in various development projects.Pantheon and its subsidiaries have valuable eminent domain and tax abatement privileges in the Pershing-Waterman project. Under the Missouri Redevelopment Corporation Law, which has been duplicated by other states, cities with populations of 4,000 or more may encourage private redevelopment corporations with the right to borrow the city's power of eminent domain and a 25-year real estate tax abatement on new improvements.Eminent domain is valuable in acquiring substantial amounts of land in a wide area. Mr. Strauss explained in a brief distributed at the conference that he believed success in Pershing-Waterman would only be possible with development on a larger, more comprehensive scale than previously proposed. That larger scale development, he said, would insure the creation of a new and secure neighborhood environment.Eminent domain involves wide land acquisition powers. Mr. Strauss notes three uses of these powers in his brief: an owner may not rehabilitate his property unless he has entered into an agreement with the developer binding him to the conditions of the development plan; the developer may acquire property if its owner rejects the developer's requirements; the city at the request of the developer will initiate a ""concentrated"" code enforcement program.Mr. Strauss termed tax abatement rights ""absolutely essential"" to make multiplefamily projects financially feasible. Under these rights, Pantheon receives a 100% tax abatement on land value and improvements for the first 10 years after the property has been acquired by the redevelopment corporation, and a 50% tax abatement for the following 15 years.Tax abatement privileges also are provided to the subsequent individual homeowner or multifamily project owner.Mr. Strauss, who has a reputation in St. Louis as a major and innovative developer, told the bankers that development is very complex and solutions difficult to find; development work requires more effort than other banking activities, he said.He reminded them that an adversary relationship between the city and developers will not work; in this case, he, the Mayor and the Council have a partnership relationship, he said. He added that the project has been an ""astounding success.""However, not everyone is pleased with Pershing-Waterman. A class action suit alleges that large numbers of low-income, mostly black, persons are being displaced by the redevelopment and that decent replacement housing is unavailable for them. It also alleges that Pantheon has failed to provide displaced residents with relocation assistance and benefits -- and is denying them the opportunity to relocate within the Pershing-Waterman area.The class action suit was filed late last year on behalf of eight tenants against Pantheon, Pershing Redevelopment Corp., the secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the city of St. Louis, the St. Louis Housing Authority, and Lipton Realty, Inc., St. Louis. The plaintiffs currently are appealing a denial of their request for a preliminary injunction to halt parts of the project.Jim Eggleston, an attorney with Legal Services of Eastern Missouri, Inc., St. Louis, who filed the suit, said the redevelopment aimed at a complete replacement of low-income residents with moderate- and upper-income people. ""Everyone wants the area developed -- but for whose benefit?"" he asked. He said the central issue is whether existing residents will be allowed to benefit from the redevelopment of their neighborhood.The suit cites developer's figures that at least 500 households were living in the area in 1976 and adds that currently about 150 households are facing displacement.It adds that only 296 of the proposed 2,500 units will be subsidized and that 112 of the subsidized units are limited to the elderly.Further, the suit claims that the many large apartments within the area had accomodated low-income families until they were displaced. They cannot afford condominiums, which have a median price of about $40,000, or new townhouses, which are selling for $69,000-$90,000.Mr. Eggleston said the power of eminent domain gives Pantheon complete control over every parcel of Land in the redevelopment area and enables it to be coercive with residents. Every property owner, he said, knows his property is subject to the developer's condemnation and therefore he often does not get fair market value.he described the case of a homeowner who was offered about $4,000 for what he said was a very solid, two-family building and who was told that perhaps he would be allowed to rent a unit in the area. The suit alleges that some residents are being illegally evicted through the termination of services to their buildings.The suit claims that displacement in Pershing-Waterman has resulted from direct governmental action -- the use of CD block grant funds -- and that displaced residents therefore are entitled to the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Act. This act provides relocation benefits of up to $4,000 for renters and $15,000 for homeowners.Mr. Eggleston, discussing the deterioration of Pershing-Waterman before the redevelopment started, said that the city deliberately cut sanitation, fire and other public services and thereby hastened its demise.Mr. Strauss replied to some of these charges in an interview following the St. Louis conference.Most displacement in Pershing-Waterman has occurred because of abandonment -- not because of the development, Mr. Strauss said.When the project started in 1974, several thousand housing units in the area were abandoned and only some 500 occupied, he said. A good number of those 500 were in dilapidated condition, he said.Asked whether Pantheon was providing any assistance to help residents find new housing, Mr. Strauss said such residents were being provided moving money, typically of about $200, and counseling. Pantheon has spent several thousand dollars in moving allowances, he said.""Nobody gets put out on the street,"" Mr. Strauss added. He denied utilities were being cut off to force people out.Mr. Strauss said that about 200 of the 500 units occupied in 1974 should qualify for Section 8 subsidized housing. He said 600 subsidized units were being built; Mr. Eggleston claims only 296 are subsidized. Pantheon, Mr. Strauss said, has just completed the first 24 of its Section 8 units, he said.Residents living in the Pershing-Waterman area get first choice for newly constructed Section 8 units, he said.Mr. Strauss noted that his firm is the only Missouri developer to have a mix of market rate and subsidized housing in the same project. Pantheon's DeBaliviere Place and Lafayette Town Projects in St. Louis contain about 25% subsidized housing.During the interview, Mr. Strauss stated strongly that he believed in control. His development firm generally makes sure that people who cause trouble for others are put out, he said. People who have criminal records or who are unemployed cannot get into the firm's apartments, he said.Mr. Strauss -- who lives just one block from the Pershing-Waterman project --said that given the dilapidated state of housing residents originally lived in, the housing they would be moving to usually would be no worse. He noted the suit was filed by tenants, not property owners, and said the URA did not apply to the project.Mr. Strauss was asked whether original residents who wanted to stay and rehabilitate their homes had any source of rehab loans (Mr. Eggleston claimed they did not). The developer replied home Improvement loans had just started to become available through a 312 loan program at about 3% interest. He said Pantheon had taken the initiative in organizing this program and noted that residents keep asking for grants, not loans.The developer admitted that finding housing for large families would be difficult and that such housing generally is difficult to find across the country.Meanwhile, Metro Housing Resources, a St. Louis organization which carried out a HUD-financed study of displacement, found ""displacement is occurring in St. Louis at a very high level, and government programs including CDBG funds play major roles in the process."" It said that bankers, developers and real estate interests in local areas are extremely influential in developing policy for CDBG expenditures and that as long as that remains the case, the housing needs of the poor will remain neglected.Discussing the Pershing-Waterman project, the study said that Lipton Realty, Inc., acts as an agent for Pantheon interests in acquiring land and buildings in the redevelopment area.""Since buildings are vacant when turned over to the redeveloper, as a condition of the sales agreement, the position the redeveloper takes is that he cannot be responsible for displacement,"" it said.In a related development, HUD in March ordered the city of St. Louis, as a condition of receiving CDBG funds, to carry out a thorough study of displacement and develop ways to minimize its effect on low-income people. The order was the first time the government has required a city to undertake a comprehensive study of the effects of housing redevelopment projects on the poor as a condition for obtaining CDBG funds.HUD said the city's strategy for dealing with displaced residents was inadequate and asked the city to identify categories of persons being displaced, detail the subsidized housing and relocation benefits it provides these persons, and explain what it is doing to prevent the poor from being displaced. CHARLOTTENorth Carolina National Bank was the first bank to be authorized by the Comptroller of the Currency to start a community development subsidiary. The subsidiary, NCNB Community Development Corp., became operational last August with initial capital outly of of $250,000. It has a full-time staff of two persons.The community development corporation's president, J. Dennis Rash, explained in interviews that the objectives of the subsidiary were twofold: to encourage an increase in the residential population, in all economic categories, in the central city of Charlotte; and to increase capital investment in the central city. The central city today has virtually no middle-class or upper-class; its population of about 2,500 is virtually all low-income.Before the subsidiary was started, the bank had been active for a number of years in an area known as the Fourth Ward, located northwest of the central business district of Charlotte. Its buildings were largely abandoned or dilapidated. Then, in 1975, Friends of Fourth Ward, a group representing city officials, businessmen and members of area churches, was organized and developed a master plan for 2,500 dwelling units of new construction and rehabilitated Victorian homes.Mr. Rash, then dean of students at the University of North Carolina in Charlotte, approached NCNB president Hugh L. McColl Jr. on behalf of the civic group to ask his assistance. Assistance was forthcoming: the bank made loans to Friends, enabling it to acquire options on about 30 properties.Today, Mr. Rash, an attorney, is president of NCNB Community Development Corporation and resident of the Fourth Ward.Starting in 1976, seven banks, including NCNB, began lending money to the city, with NCNB serving without compensation as agent, so that the city could make 6% loans available to residents who would commit themselves to become owner-occupants in the Fourth Ward. About $1.5 million in commitments have been made.The role of the bank and the CD subsidiary in the Fourth Ward was developing the financial concept, marketing and obtaining governmental approval for the redevelopment, Mr. Rash said. ""A sense of alliance"" -- between many partners, such as banks, city officials, businessmen, and historic preservation groups --he said.The CD subsidiary has acquired title to property valued at about $700,000. This consists of vacant land, which will be developed into townhouses, and a 54-unit apartment building, which probably will be converted into condominium units. It bought the apartment building because it wanted vacant land, which the owners insisted on selling together.The subsidiary has the advantage of knowing that if it has townhouse units built in the Fourth Ward, owners of the units will be able to obtain attractive 6% financing.The subsidiary is a nonprofit subsidiary but ""aggresively wants to make a profit,' Mr. Rash said in an interview.The Comptroller's Office required that at least one-third of the CD subsidiary's board consist of persons associated with the Fourth Ward, Mr. Rash said. Of the current 12-member board, eight persons are from outside the bank and four are bank members.NCNB personnel have been active in Fourth Ward development. Mr. McColl gave his commitment, and the bank formed a Fourth Ward taskforce of about 20 employees, of whom a half-dozen were intensively involved. They provided skills in marketing, public relations, financing and credit analysis, and planning.The bank did not have a role in helping obtain public funds in the Fourth Ward, Mr. Rash said. Community Development block grants were not used in the area. However, in a referendum held two years ago, voters approved a $9.6 million bond issue which will be used to fund a new museum of science and restoration of a performing arts center. Both are located near the Fourth Ward.Asked about any problem of displacing existing residents from Fourth Ward, Mr. Rash said, ""The bank felt a responsibility to symbolically demonstrate it didn't want to create massive displacement."" Thus, NCNB made a renovation loan to a minority, nonprofit construction firm for the renovation of an apartment building designed to house four households of low-income residents.Meanwhile, a nonprofit corporation established by the Junior League assisted some individuals needing relocation assistance.The bank will try to minimize negative effects of displacement, Mr. Rash said. Before it commits itself to convert its apartment building to condominium units, it will have a plan ready for dealing with displacement, he said. It might develop and renovate property which is vacant or under-utilized, and after renovating it, provide that building for those residents, he said.Speaking generally, he said he thought banks should be thoughtful and humane in the activities they undertake.At the conference, Mr. Rash said NCNB was visiting about 15 cities in North Carolina and talking to city officials as a preliminary move to expanding the work of the CD subsidiary in 1980 to other areas of the state.
MINNEAPOLISThe Loring Park District DEvelopment is being accomplished through tax increment financing. James L. Hetland, Jr., senior vice president of FNB Minneapolis, explained in interviews that TIF involves these steps: the city designates an area a development district; assessments are frozen; the city issues bonds to acquire land and to make public improvements; and the bonds are repaid from increased tax revenues resulting from the development.City need, not blight, is needed to declare an area a development district in Minneapolis.The city issued $21 million of deductible general obligation bonds for the project.The development involves a nine square block area south of the central business district of Minneapolis. The project proposed to build 2,700 new units to replace 1,040 mostly deteriorated units. Of the new units, 76% are market rate condominium or townhouse units.Banks provided financing for the development in different ways.FNB Minneapolis, the $863 million-deposit Farmers and Mechanics Savings Bank, and the $1.9 billion-deposit Northwestern National Bank, Minneapolis, made a construction loan of $6.9 million for the building of condominium units.Some banks also promised to grant take-out mortgages to individual purchasers of those units, although the usury ceiling then was 8%, a rate below the cost of new funds.Mr. Hetland worked on the Loring Park project from the start as a member of a task force established by the Downtown Council, a group of businessmen. The task force provided market studies and packaging advice. Mr. Hetland consulted often with his bank's construction real estate officials and commercial lending officers.He said his bank did not help obtain public funds. Community development block grant funds were used in the project. The city committed public and private non-profit funds for the construction of four new buildings: an orchestra hall; a YMCA; a community college; and a vocational school. A new hotel also was part of the project.Mr. Hetland said his bank and others which are members of the Downtown Council helped put the development project together. The city used several developers in this project; in developments in other cities only one developer is used.The city was hampered in acquiring land because it did not have the right of eminent domain. However, the city swapped land with the community college and vocational school, both of which wanted to build new structures in the district, and used their eminent domain authority.A market study which was conducted indicated a strong demand for housing from young couples without children and older adults whose children had grown and left home.Mr. Hetland recommended greater consideration of leasing, rather than purchasing, land for use in development projects. Developers could be provided with an option to lease the land from the city rather than buy title to the land at a marked down price, he said.Leasing would reduce lenders' up front capital commitment and would enable the city to recover its entire capital cost for the land, Mr. Hetland said.In the Loring Park development, 248 single persons and 24 families had to be relocated. Thirty per cent of the tax increment bond issue was allocated for relocation expenses. The city employed a relocation counselor to assist residents relocate near the Loring Park area.The Loring Park project includes some subsidized housing, being built by the Salvation Army with federal Section 8 funds, and some housing for the elderly, being built by Volunteers of America subsidiaries.Mr. Hetland said in interviews that displacement of Loring Park residents was unfortunate but unavoidable, yet recommended that banks recognize the human factors in development. He said that he did not think banks had a responsibility to find alternative housing for displaced persons and said that few original residents were retained in the redeveloped Loring Park area.On the other hand, Mr. Hetland said that perhaps displaced homeowners should be allowed to have the right to become owners again, for example of a condominium unit. Relocation will have to be recognized as an essential part of the development process, and public housing agencies will have to find alternative housing or pay relocation benefits, he suggested.He Said that if a city governmental agency were to adopt a land acquisition policy, banks might make loans to enable displaced homeowners to buy housing elsewhere.
CHICAGOAt a workshop at the St. Louis conference, Ronald Grzywinski, chairman and director of the $55.7 million-deposit South Shore Bank of Chicago, said that the least understood ingredient of neighborhood decline is the neighborhood's loss of self-confidence. This loss is seen in the behavior of schools, churches and banks.Banks and homeowners may react apprehensively to racial and economic change in their neighborhood and participate in a self-fulfilling prophecy that their neighborhood is going downhill, Mr. Grzywinski said.Banks should encourage self-confidence by investing and engaging in other activities, he suggested. When new management took over South Shore in 1973, it had to convince the community and employees it knew the neighborhood would improve, he said.It went to many community meetings and talked to dozens of residents, extended hours, tried to convince employees their success depended on good, courteous service -- South Shore has ""not succeeded to my satisfaction"" on that goal --replacing threadbare drapes and planting new trees in front of the bank, he said.Explaining South Shore's success -- it does not have any 30-day delinquencies on any of its multi-family development loans worth $2.8 million -- Mr. Grzywinski pointed to these factors: South Shore loaned only in its primary service area; it made extensive use of loan guarantees; it hired staff which had good problem-solving ability but no previous banking experience; and established an advocacy role on a management level.An example of the advocacy role is a procedure whereby a three-man member management team reviews all loan turndowns.Mr. Grzywinski, 43, Chicago-born and a former salesman of International Business Machines computers to banks, said the commercial district is the part of the South Shore community which ""is showing the least improvement."" Merchants are under capitalized and inexperienced, he said."

Bright Economic Future Predicted for New Jersey,The American Banker,"May 15, 1979, Tuesday","We at Midlantic, however, are frankly bullish about the economic future of New Jersey. We feel that New Jersey, being ideally situated between Boston and Washington in the middle of 36 million people, is not only an excellent location for business but is also a prime area for the banking industry.Let's look at some of the facts which support this optimism. Although New Jersey is 46th among the states in size, it ranks eight in industrial output. Looking at particular industries within the state, New Jersey ranks first in pharmaceuticals, second in chemicals, fifth in rubber and plastics, and within the top ten in petroleum products and refining, apparel, electrical machinery, paper products, printing and publishing, textiles, instruments, leather and food products.While the industrial sector remains strong, the economic base in New Jersey is diversifying. There is growing strength in service industries.This upsurge in service organizations had created a need for better trained, better educated individuals to handle a wide variety of better paying jobs in selling, research and development, banking, insurance and other professional fields. The results of this can be seen in the income figures for New Jersey residents. Our state's 7.5 million consumers rank first in the continental United States for median effective buying income per household.New Jersey's recovery from the recession of the mid-1970s has been strong. For example, the number of New Jersey residents employed has increased by 321,000 from the recession low point of May, 1975. We have also seen retail sales and construction contracts increase significantly over the past three years. Recent studies by Touche Ross & Co. and the New Jersey Business and Industry Association support the position of the Byrne Administration that the state's economic house is in good order and headed toward even brighter horizons.A number of areas throughout the state are fast developing into major recreational and business centers. The Meadowlands Sports Complex, located only a few minutes from New York City, is one of the most successful sports facilities in the country. Financed by New Jersey banks (including Midlantic) and insurance companies, the 78,000 seat stadium and racetrack represents an investment of $340 million. The stadium houses the Giants football and Cosmos soccer teams, while the racetrack can provide thoroughbred and harness racing to over 35,000 fans each day. It is anticipated that the New Jersey Nets will be housed in a 20,000 seat basketball arena which is scheduled for completion by 1981.In the surrounding Meadowlands area, a number of major corporations have started construction of new facilities with a long list of other leading companies scheduled to follow. Included in the comprehensive Land Use Plan of the Hackensack Meadowlands Development Commission is a 2,000 acre park and wildlife preserve and a 650 unit waterfront recreational community.In the southern part of the state, casino gambling has stimulated a revitalization of Atlantic City. Resorts International, the first casino to open, employs over 3,000, attracts many visitors and is realizing excellent profits. The Atlantic City Master Plan calls for the completion of between eight and eighteen casinos by 1990. This new construction will provide some 35,000 to 50,000 employment opportunities within the casino industry and up to 70,000 new jobs in related industries.Midlantic has already made its presence felt in this area by providing permanent financing to Caesars world, Inc.'s Boardwalk Regency. This casino and hotel is scheduled to open in late spring and will bring an additional 3,000 new jobs to Atlantic City. Our planned acquisition of Atlantic National Bank, which is subject to appropriate approvals, will give Midlantic a physical presence in this developing community as well.Newark, the 16th largest standard metropolitan statistical area in our nation, has made significant progress during the last decade. Newark leads the state as a banking center, with more than 30 financial institutions of all types located there. Ranked third in the nation as an insurance center, Newark is the home of Prudential Insurance Company of America, the world's largest insurance company, and Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company. A symbol of the continuing development of the city is the construction of the $60 million Park Plaza complex, home of the Public Service Electric & Gas Company.A $180 million effort is also underway for the economic development and neighborhood preservation of New Brunswick. Plans for this area include a $50 million corporate headquarters for Johnson & Johnson, $45 million for extending Route 18 and $12 million in other new office buildings.Throughout New Jersey, activity points to progress. Adding to statewide developments, a taskforce of businessmen --Investment Mission 1979 -- was formed to help attract international companies to New Jersey. Representatives from statewide organizations recently travelled to Europe to meet company representatives and public officials from West Germany, Switzerland and England. This group of New Jersey businessmen, led by Gov. Brendan T. Byrne, brought the message of economic opportunity in the State of New Jersey to the international business community.Markets for our state's products are unlimited. New Jersey has two of the busiest seaports in the world -- Port Neward and Port Elizabeth. The modern, high capacity air cargo facilities of Newark Airport are growing at an annual rate of 25%. Thousands of miles of highways and rail connections comprise a modern transportation system which has great appeal to industry.New Jersey has grown and will keep growing with the financial support of its banking community. Our state is indeed a state of economic opportunity and that creates a favorable climate for bankers. Throughout the state, banking has become a highly sophisticated, highly competitive industry.Midlantic is proud of the role we have played in the economic development of New Jersey and is committed to such a posture in the future. We feel that we are well positioned to carry out that commitment. We are now a $2.6 billion holding company with 114 offices located in 13 counties throughout New Jersey. We offer a full line of sophisticated services to the corporate market including credit, cash management, international, trust and investment, acquisition and automated services. Through our affiliated companies we also offer factoring, mortgage banking and leasing services. Our capabilities on the retail side of our business are equally impressive, including the availability of up-to-date electronic funds transfer facilities, such as our automated teller network.Midlantic is extremely optimistic about the future of New Jersey and plans to continue to bolster our state's economy by supporting business within the state and by attracting new business to New Jersey. This is Midlantic's way of providing New Jersey with the recognition it deserves and keeping its vitality high in the years ahead."
Poring Through the Proxy,The American Banker,"April 10, 1979, Tuesday","The employment records and ages of directors always have been good clues as to how effective a board is.A number of board members' listing a main occupation of ""investments"" or ""retired"" always has suggested that a bank was not paring its board frequently enough. For even though an individual may still be vigorous and questioning, if he is out of the mainstream of business activity his usefulness to the bank has been diminished.Too many persons like this on a board can lead one to suspect that the board spends more time talking about the ""good old days"" or ""how we used to do it"" than facing the problems at hand.A bank should have as directors people in all stages of life -- rising in their professions, at their prime and able to bring seasoned judgment and experience, to be used to the bank's best advantage.Now proxy materials are showing just how active board members are.Attendance by itself is not necessarily a sign of an active board member. But without being at the meeting, a board member has no way of playing a full role in deliberations and decision-making. Too many absences is abdication of directorship. Now such absences can be monitored by stockholders.There is little doubt that board membership in banks in this country is undergoing profound changes. The legal responsibilities are increasing and making it more difficult to recruit businessmen who are best qualified to gauge a bank's financial performance.The demands of the community for active lending programs in disadvantaged areas, and for sensitivity by banking institutions to the implications of a broad range of social, economic and environmental problems, has made it desirable to broaden significantly the intellectual range and experience of the board as a whole. Wisdom, as well as good judgment, must somehow become a product of the board's deliberations.Board membership can no longer be a pleasant sinecure. The days when the job was all prestige and little responsibility are long gone. Most board members realize how serious their obligation is and how much liability they have undertaken.Ignorance is no excuse under the law, despite the highly technical nature of banking, and this disturbs many board members as they look upon their responsibilities.And board members have been forced by the regulators to make restitution to their banks for losses, even though they themselves were not implicated in the problems -- simply because they should have known what was going on.Thus, fewer and fewer persons are accepting board seats. But the point remains: if directorship is accepted, it must be handled with full heart. Proxy data will show the observant whether this is still the case among some of the board members serving America's banks.Nevertheless, for all the problems, irritations and liabilities, service on a board should be regarded as a challenge and a privilege. There can be few duties in the business community which properly discharged, yield such a degree of satisfaction as that of director of a well run bank, whatever its size. Operating officers should be able to find in their communities or nearby qualified individuals who, properly challenged and approached, would be honored to assume the responsibilities of a directorship."
Banking Democracy,The American Banker,"February 7, 1979, Wednesday","This is the statute now familiar to bankers which requires regulatory agencies to publish proposed rules in the Federal Register, allow the public time to comment on them, and in many cases provide for judicial review.Much banking supervision remains at the discretion of the regulatory agencies but bankers themselves are afforded the opportunity, through the comment process, to help shape most of the rules under which they do business.But just as few citizens vote in primary elections and few attend the public meetings of the governing bodies in their communities, so few bankers avail themselves of this opportunity to make themselves heard.What's more, the comments useful to the regulators tend to reflect the views of the management of the big banks. If they are made by the executives of small banks, they often are short, snappy protests against the proposal which the regulators find of limited value.""It is well known that the quality and quantity of banker comment on proposals is marginal,"" said Philip F. Searle, chairman of Flagship Banks Inc., Miami, in a recent talk.Speaking in Hollywood, Fla., to a Bank Administration Institute conference, Mr. Searle said the content of the regulations may be a product of the input, or lack of input, on the part of banking organizations.When the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. asked for comment on its review process on remote service facility applications, Mr. Searle noted the agency received only five letter in two months -- four in favor, one opposed.When the Securities and Exchange Commission proposed amendments to Article 9 of Regulation S-X on the content of financial statements of banks and their holding companies, it got 132 comments from banking organizations and 28 from other organizations on the first draft. A revised proposal drew 83 comments from banking organizations and 19 from others.It would seem that, given the far-reaching implications of the proposed amendments, far more banking organizations should have replied than actually did,"" Mr. Searle said.On the other hand, in the opinion of some, the final amendments as announced by the SEC did not necessarily represent good reporting or disclosure as regards banking, which end result could discourage companies commenting upon those proposal from doing so in the future.""Mr. Searle called for a more meaningful effort, chiefly by top bank managers using the talents of their executives to the fullest, but also by encouraging other bankers and their organizations to comment.Mr. Searle did not acknowledge in his talk the lack of in-house expertise at many community banks, which would enable them to comment meaningfully on proposals. Or on the limited time for such chores available to their executives. If community bank presidents commented on every banking proposal in the Federal Register, they would have time for little else.But he did point up the need for banking to raise the contribution it makes in regulation-making to the level it enjoys in lawmaking.In the past the banking industry has properly placed great emphasis on input with respect to prospective legislation,"" Mr. Searle said.""Its record in improving proposed legislation prior to enactment is rather good and, I believe, has improved materially in recent years. Faced with more and more governmental control over banking by regulatory fiat, it is critically important that the industry heighten its efforts to improve regulations by furnishing greatly increased input into the stream of meaningful comments on regulatory proposals."""
"ABA Convention Opens October 5; Kissinger, Long Slated to Speak",The American Banker,"September 26, 1979, Wednesday","More than 11,000 bankers and their spouses already have registered to attend the convention -- a pre-registration rate running 14% ahead of the two previous stateside conventions held by the ABA, whose membership includes over 90% of the nation's 14,500 banks.Following ""early bird"" registration Oct. 5, a participatory session of community bankers Oct. 6 from 10:30 to noon at the New Orleans Hilton Hotel will focus on coping with Federal legislation and regulations, areas in which community bankers play a key role in formulating and implementing ABA policy.

"The Growth of International Banking ;
Chicago's Development as an International Banking Center",The American Banker,"March 23, 1979, Friday","Since 1973, when the Illinois Foreign Banking Office Act first permitted foreign banks to establish branches in the central business district of Chicago, 31 foreign banks have chosen to locate general banking offices here.Arriving during the first year were branches of such worldwide banking houses as Barclays Bank International, Ltd. and National Westminster Bank, Ltd. of England, Swiss Bank Corporation, and the National Bank of Greece. In January, Credit Agricole Bank of France, one of the largest banks in the world, announced that Chicago would be the site of its home office in the United States.The intervening years saw Chicago become a host city for branches of banks headquartered in 16 countries, including several Western European, Asian and Latin American na tions. Nineteen foreign banks also have representative offices in Chicago, and three subsidiaries of foreign banks -- two from Japan and one from Italy -- are located in the city.With four branches, seven representative offices and two subsidiaries, Japanese banks have opened the most foreign banking facilities in Chicago, followed by Canadian banks with five representative offices.As more foreign banks arrived in Chicago and as the branches became more established, loan volume of the foreign banks grew rapidly. At the end of 1974, a total of $417 million in loans were outstanding at the city's 17 foreign branches. By September 30, 1978, loans by foreign banks in Chicago had grown to $2.3 billion and accounted for 8.4% of total loans of major Chicago banks.This rapid expansion of foreign banking operations in the city in the past five years has been encouraged by a number of factors, including a favorable climate for business. The Chicago metropolitan area is the home of a number of the largest U.S. companies, including headquarters of about 40 Fortune 500 corporations and facilities of a growing number of foreign companies. Many businesses are attracted to Chicago because of its central location, transportation, labor force, and position as the capital of the farm belt.Chicago's O'Hare Airport is the busiest in the world, with some 50 million people passing through its terminal in 1978. O'Hare also handled more than 400,000 tons of cargo and mail last year.To facilitate the shipment of manufactured goods, grain and other farm products, the Port of Chicago is building a container port and other facilities at the mouth of the Calumet River on Lake Michigan. Also important to world financial markets are the Chicago Board of Trade, Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and Chicago Board Options Exchange.The Chicago metropolitan area is the largest center of manufacturing activity in the country, with some 14,000 manufacturing firms. Many of these companies are actively involved in exporting their products and require the services of banks that can meet their needs around the world.With this high level of business activity and growth, it was inevitable that the world's largest banking institutions would be drawn to Chicago.From the beginning, Continental Bank encouraged the development of an international banking community in Chicago. Although the new entrants have heightened competition among banks and other financial institutions, they also have done their part to stimulate international business activity in the Midwest.With the increased demand for credit in 1978, loans by Chicago's foreign banking community rose 16%, while the asset base remained at the yearend 1977 level of $3.3 billion. According to the Federal Reserve, commercial and industrial loans account for about 45% of the total assets of the foreign branches in the city, increasing the foreign banking community's share of commercial and industrial loans to almost 11%, from less than 1% in 1972.Due to the predominantly wholesale banking activities of foreign banks, many foreign branches have turned to other financial institutions in the U.S. as sources of funds to support their lending operations. Borrowing by Chicago's foreign branches from U.S. commercial banks rose 35% during the first nine months of 1978, the latest period for which statistics are available.Increased international banking activity in Chicago and across the United States also is having its effect on the U.S. banking system. The International Banking Act passed by Congress last year goes a long way toward putting foreign branches on equal footing with U.S. banks.In the future, branches of foreign banks in Chicago and elsewhere will not gain a competitive advantage by opening branches in several states, avoiding reserve requirements, or acquiring U.S. banks that antitrust laws kept out of reach of domestic banks. Although details implementing the Act have not been completed, the Federal Reserve Board and the Comptroller of the Currency have new authority in the areas of licensing, reserve requirements, interstate branching, insurance of domestic deposits, supervision and audits of foreign bank offices, and non-banking activities.The future of foreign banking activity in Chicago, like the future of international banking itself, is tied to the growth of the world economy. Recent oil price increases by the OPEC nations and political unrest overseas have pointed out the interdependence of all segments of the world economy, including industy and international banking in Chicago. However, the Midwest has been favored with a broad-based, diversified economy that has made the region's industry less vulnerable to business fluctuations than other sections of the country.Nevertheless, the declining value of the dollar and slower economic growth in other major industrial nations have led to greater foreign investment in the Midwest. The 1970s have witnessed a dramatic increase in foreign purchases of U.S. stocks and bonds as well as acquisition of U.S. production facilities and the construction of new foreign-owned plants.As more foreign corporations regard the United States as a major factor in their investment plans, more foreign-owned banks, seeking to expand services to customers in their home countries, will be drawn to this attractive market. In 1972, U.S. branches and subsidiaries of foreign banks had total assets of $25 billion; today these assets approach $120 billion.With the city's aggressive business and financial community, Chicago's role in international banking will continue to grow in importance and scope. Competition will heighten as major international banks in Chicago vie for corporate business with foreign branches of some of the largest banks in the world.This new level of competition will be based on tighter profit margins, more sophisticated banking system, and improvements in communications technology.To companies conducting business around the world, the growth and maturity of international banking in Chicago will mean that both the range of banking services and the cost-effectiveness of those services will continue to grow.Picture, Alfred F. Miossi"
Continuing Growth of Bank Service Market Seen for 1980s,The American Banker,"December 7, 1979, Friday","I say this after fully recognizing that there are economic, technological and market forces pushing us toward further concentrations of economic power. We may expect continuing advances toward nationwide banking, expanding holding company growth across state lines, and increased banking powers for thrift institutions and credit unions. We may expect increased competition from other entities -- brokers, finance companies, foreign banks, insurance companies, money market funds, and retailers.And until we are able to define and limit government's role in the market system, we may expect continued competition from government agencies and even the regulators.I fully expect that the Federal Reserve will become a strong competitor; study the parallels now provided in the services offered by the Federal Reserve and correspondent banks. Payment of interest on reserves, mandatory reserves, and explicit pricing and ""unbundling"" can have sizeable impacts upon deposit relationships as they are now constituted.And so the marching orders for bankers, and the correspondent banks and bankers that serve them, must be cut now for the decade of the 1980s.Specifically, the market for correspondent banking is a mirror image for banking generally. Our ability to profitably satisfy the financial needs of our customers is the more important factor in staying viable. By satisfying customer needs we are at once, and by definition, leaders and innovators.There are over 14,500 banking institutions serving the United States today but only about 350 of these staff and maintain active correspondent or financial institutions departments. These departments provide help and expertise in 40 basic banking services, including check collection, overline and liquidity loan participations, Federal funds transactions, electronic data processing, and wire transfers. They also include offering personnel services and assistance in advertising and public relations among others. This list of services and needs is expanding.Operational and technical challenges of community banks may be profitably satisfied. The inevitable and necessary shift from paper items to electronics will demand servicing help from correspondent banks. NOW accounts, debit and credit card issuance and control, EFT networks, automatic teller machine placement and servicing, investment advice and portfolio analysis, sale training and specialized schooling -- each of these categories represent services to be offered.These services and new ones that will appear in the 1980s must be provided to respondent banks (those banks which are the receivers of services) to help them to continue to satisfy their customer needs. They may also be provided to other financial intermediaries without damage to our market if these providers are subject to the same rules and regulations, and they may also be provided to foreign banking institutions.In a recent professional opinion survey conducted by the correspondent banking division of the American Bankers Association of both correspondent and respondent banks, several key factors appeared to help strengthen my belief in the expansion of correspondent banking in the 1980s. Compensation by fees rather than balances was projected to grow faster than expected. With proper costing and pricing, this can be an expanding ""hard dollar"" income provider for correspondent banks.But of even more significance in the survey was the fact that most respondent banks did not expect to provide the specified services for themselves! They were saying that as banks, and bankers managing those banks, that they had a continuing customer need to be fulfilled. In my opinion, this can and should take place within the banking framework --not on a governmental level or by outside vendors.In order to continue to build the case for correspondent banking, I assume that bank senior management will understand the growing bank servicing market and will act accordingly. At this writing I am aware that several of the nation's largest banks are rapidly adding to facilities and staff in this regard. These are banks that had made decisions to downplay this phase of banking in the late 1960s and 1970s. There must be a continuing commitment of resources including increased selection standards and training of calling officers, innovations in lending facilities for interbank credits, and a respect for the ability and judgement of community bankers.Our system of correspondent banking is unique to our nation and one that is many-times overlooked from an historical perspective. We have enjoyed an economic and regulatory balance provided by a dual banking system; this has been supported by correspondent banking. We have, at least in the past, declined the proposition of a monolithic central bank. I would hope, most strongly, that we continue this tradition.Correspondent banking in the 1980s and banking generally must present its case well with the public in the market place.There is a burgeoning need for credit facilities for agriculture and middle-tier corporations, throughout the country, for example, that is straining agricultural and community bank's lending limits. That loan demand can be serviced through the banking system -- a challenge to all of us as bankers get better communication and documentation flowing. Handling this need at all points in the economic cycle will help us earn and share the public's trust. Our advertising and public relations efforts can be no more effective than our individual and collective actions.Agricultural and emerging corporate credit is but one of the many examples as to the way in which correspondents may serve banks and the public in a continuing manner. It takes on growing importance as population and industry begins a shift back to the smaller communities and rural areas of the country. In the areas of financial management, productivity management, and specialized banking expertise, there is a growing market. We must be ""service-based.""Our perspectives as bankers, totally, must be broadened. We must train individuals in banking fundamentals, yes, but also in human engineering responses and needs. For expansion of correspondent banking to take place we must emphasize a professional approach to banking and marketing. By professional, I imply that we go beyond the merely technical skills necessitated and also exercise qualities of understanding, helpfulness, and confidentiality. There are unique partnerships that have been formed between correspondent and respondent bankers through the years that transcend a more ""hard pencil"" approach to business. We ignore these personal relationships strengths at our peril.The advocate, the preacher in me, takes hold. In my opinion, the community banks throughout this country are reservoirs of leadership, economic balance, and stability. It is to our overall advantage as a society to continue these institutions. The bonds of respect between correspondent and respondent banks and bankers can help achieve this goal of continuance.Correspondent banks may help respondents in the 1980s by helping structure a more realistic and responsive level of interest rates to offset the advent of money market certificates and the apparent demise of Regulation Q. We may also encourage customer payments of portfolio fees for banking services and help in the reduction of personnel costs through automation and planning.Capital adequacy and the effects of continuing inflation are problems that can be addressed by correspondents and respondents working together. Understanding may be reached in the 1980s regarding a united stand against regressive and burdensome ""over regulation.""Correspondent banks should continue in bank stock ownership financing, also, because of excellent quality of the underlying assets and to maintain freedom of entry into the marketplace.And so there it is and here it is: a cursory brief for the growth and health of correspondent banking in the 1980s. But not without study, planning, and effort on our part.And so there it is and here it is. A cursory brief for the growth and health of correspondent banking in the 1980s. But not without study, planning, and effort on our part. As correspondent bankers, and as bankers as a total group, we must strive for excellence."
Pa. Mutual Branch Opposed on CRA,The American Banker,"November 26, 1979, Monday","It asked the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to turn down the application at a public hearing, attended by more than 75 people, at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.It was the first challenge to a Philadelphia bank under the Community Reinvestment Act.The Rev. Joseph M. Kakalec, president of the Philadelphia Council of Neighborhood Organizations, and David Bartlet, visiting professor of Urban Studies at Temple University, accused the bank of redlining Northwest Philadelphia.The Rev. Kakalec said ""the record clearly shows the bulk of Germantown Savings Bank's current lending to be in the predominantly white and affluent areas of the suburbs.""Mr. Bartlet said that 54% of the bank's deposits come from Philadelphia but, only 10% of its mortgage money is invested in the city.He said that 86% of all the bank's mortgages go to areas that are more than 95% white.In a 25-minute reply to the charges, Samuel Evans 3d, Germantown president, said the Bartlet study did not meet any of the standard criteria for scholarly work in the social sciences. Mr. Evans also accused Prof. Bartlet of using percentages unfairly. He said the home mortgage statistics did not include money lent for multifamily dwellings.Regional FDIC director James L. Sexton said a decision on the application would be made within 30 days."
Banks Calm On Sears Note Plan,The American Banker,"February 13, 1979, Thursday","Spokesman for banks and thrift institutions said they were hardly excited over facing a new competitor for the savings dollar under a debt plan disclosed by Sears.But they also warned, that the banking community might challenge the offering, considering that the merchandising chain already holds a pre-eminent role as an instalment lender with nationwide pentration.Sears officials emphasized that their planned offering of ""intermediate-term notes"" through mailing to credit-card customers and possibly through store sales was still in its early stages, with ""many details to be worked out.""Yet the Chicago-based retailer said it probably would register with the Securities and Exchange Commission a public offering of $500 million. No date for the offering has been set, Sears said.Jack F. Kincannon, senior vice president of finance, said the Sears notes would be offered ""in minimum amounts of $1,000 at fluctuating interest rates for different periods of time.""The offering ""is intended to provide a new source of funds for general and corporate purposes, a Sears news release said.Terms of the notes, it was understood, will vary from two to about 10 years, but it was uncertain whether they would become negotiable.The United States League of Savings Association here said it found it ""hard to believe"" Sears would use this ""expensive"" way to borrow money through direct sale of the notes to individuals rather than use traditional channels.Norman Strunk, executive vice president of the league, said that although Sears retains a vast network of stores, it ""has no teller operation"" to handle financial transactions of this kind.Moreover, he said, ""Sears has no Federal deposit insurance"" to protect borrowers.The Chicago merchandiser ""is also laying itself open to big disclosure problems,"" pointed out one banking executive. He cited Sears' weakened sales record and adverse financial publicity within recent months.""A filing of this kind with the SEC will raise all kinds of questions about financial condition of Sears,"" one banking source declared. ""It won't be cut-and-dried.""In objecting to the Sears offering, banking groups would likely raise the insurance issue as well as questions on the placement of the secured notes in Sears' own debt inventory.""Do they fall in front of or behind bank debt?"" asked one bank trade assocaition executive.Mr. Strunk said it was too early to know whether the league would attempt to block the offering planned for 1980.""It is a free country and I, guess there are laws to permit it,"" Mr. Strunk declared, adding: ""It may be there is no way to stop Sears, Roebuck.""Sears officials cautioned newsmen about the ""speculative"" nature of the offering, pointing out that 1980 is still a long way off.Nonetheless, Sears said that if it proceeds with the offering, if it intends to make use of the company's 25 million credit card customers, in the hope of reaching ""a new class of investor -- those people who might never walk into a broker's office.""Sears said it does not seek the small saver as an investor but wishes to diversify its financing.The USLSA said it could not recall a similar financing venture by a firm the size of Sears, although consumer finance firms have made public offerings of a smaller scale.American Telephone & Telegraph Co. caused a stir in 1970 when it disclosed it was considering offering unsecured debentures in denominations as small as $100 each through its 2,000 or so business offices.When financial institutions pointed out the danger of disintermediation, AT&T shelved the plans. But it has never abandoned them.In New York, a spokesman for AT&T said Friday the plans have not been shelved permanently but the company does not intend to do anything similar to Sears in the foreseeable future.""The Sears offering would just add to a whole host of high-rate short-term options available to the public,"" Elmer M. Harmon, executive vice president of the $4.6 billion-deposit Bowery Savings Bank, New York, said.""Money market certificates are doing fabulously well, which means we can hold our own in obtaining funds, and the proposed Sears plan becomes just part of the competitive game,"" he declared.There also seemed little concern within the New York commercial banking community. One banker said the Sears action would most affect the investment banking industry, which traditionally provides the medium-America's corporations. ""Our lending patterns to corporate customers is, ""in the main, short-term,"" the banker said.An official at another large New York City bank noted that with the Gray Panthers petitioning the Federal Reserve Board to lower the minimum denomination from $10,000 to $500 on money market instruments, the Sears notes would just be another competitive investment. The Gray Panthers is an organization representing senior citizens."
No Easy Route to Keeping Up,The American Banker,"May 30, 1979, Wednesday","There is no easy route to keeping up. No magic formulas. No real short-cuts. Keeping up can be hard work and can be inconvenient. But as I told my University of Virginia students in my last session with them before their graduation: ""If you don't keep up, if you don't work at it constantly, you can forget about being a marketer.""This is a column about keeping up, about knowledge building. This is a column about reading and listening and observing.There is no more efficient way into the minds or actions of others than reading. To be sure, reading does not present uniformly rewarding or pleasant or worthwhile experiences. We sometimes read the wrong material. We sometimes read the right material but it's laborious and not much fun. We frequently forget what we read.And yet a vigorous commitment to reading is indispensable to anyone who wishes to keep up. Reading brings into the realm of one's own experience the ideas, the points-of-view, the reports, the findings, the experiences of others. When we do stumble on the ""right material,"" the material may redirect our thinking on an important subject, it may challenge us to learn more about the subject, it may open our eyes. When we read avidly and widely we grow, we build an informed perspective, we see patterns in experience where no patterns were apparent before, we become better thinkers. Reading can be exhilerating!Here are some tips on being a more productive reader:1. Think of reading as you think of eating or jogging; it is something you do regularly; it is a part of your normal routine.2. Allocate set times during the day for reading, for example, an hour each morning before going to work or 8 to 10 during the evening.3. Read a variety of material including selected nonbanking publications. The following list exemplifies the variety that is important to a bank marketer: Bank Marketing, Advertising Age, American Banker, Business Week, Bankers Magazine, Harvard Business Review, United States Banker, Futurist, Journal of Retail Banking (new from Consumer Bankers Association), Fortune, Bank Administration, Savings and Loan News, and Journal of Marketing. Additionally, there are selected newsletters, special research reports, and internal bank documents to be read.4.Have colleagues read for you. One way to cope with the outpouring of reading materials is to divide up coverage among a group of co-workers. Each member of the group is responsible for a specific list of publications and for routing especially worthwhile articles to other group members.5. Maintain reference files. To facilitate restudy of particularly valuable reading material, maintain a set of reference files. The files would include copies or clippings of the valued material and would be categorized according to relevant subject matter.6. Read books. There is a tendency to avoid books (which can be very timeconsuming) because of the unrelenting stream of other reading material that crosses one's desk. This is a tendency that should be fiercely resisted. Books can provide a depth of examination, a cohesiveness and comprehensiveness, a penetrating insight into another person's mind, and a freedom of expression often absent from periodicals. Book selections should not just be restricted to ""business"" books and should include novels. At any given point in time, it's a good idea to have a book under way.7. Form a book study group. One way to mesh ideas from an author with those of colleagues is to form a book study group. The study group, comprising a half-dozen or so colleagues, would meet regularly, say early morning one day a week, examining a selected book chapter-by-chapter in terms of its implications for the bank. Major books, for example Peter Drucker's Management Tasks, Responsibilities, Practices, are especially appropriate for study group use.
LISTENINGJust as reading is an indispensable activity for keeping up, so is listening. And just as being a good reader requires a personal chemistry of discipline, skill, and habit, so does listening. The fact is, talking is more fun than listening but listening is usually more valuable.The good listener listens continuously, to a variety of people, in a variety of forums. The good listener agressively seeks out the opportunity to listen to that which is worthwhile. Or said differently, good listening involves making good listening opportunities happen, not just listening good when they do happen.Here are some tips on being a more productive listener:1. Try to attend at least one outside conference, workshop, or educational meeting each quarter. Transform what is typically an irregular activity into a regular one.2. Attend a variety of educational forums rather than always attending the same conference or workshop year in and year out. Different kinds of meetings are much more likely to introduce new people and new ideas than the same meetings every year. Moreover, try to include at least one nonbanking meeting each year. The annual Conference Board marketing workshop held each fall is an example of an unusually good educational opportunity to which few bankers avail themselves.3. Ask banking trade groups putting on meetings to include some industry ""outsiders"" on the program. A common tendency in banking meetings is for insiders (plus a few government officials) to talk to insiders, for only ""safe"" people to be put on the program, indeed, for the same people to continually reappear on programs. This is perhaps a comfortable existence but not a smart one. Banking is an industry that quite clearly does not operate in a vacuum and it cannot afford the luxury of insulated meetings. Urban planners, futurists, industry critics, leaders in the black community, behavioral scientists, leaders of the feminist movement, experts from other service industries (for example, people from such companies as Marriott and Braniff), academics, leading retailers, novelists -- these are the types of people --ment officials -- that should be included on the speaker lists at many banking industry meetings.4. Bring outsiders into the bank for regularly scheduled dialogue sessions with bank personnel.These outsiders need not always be high-powered experts who command sizable speaking fees. Much can be learned, for example, by inviting into the bank for an exchange of views small groups of community newcomers, first-time homebuyers, community consumer leaders, and college students.5. Regularly venture out of the office and into the community to learn what others -- branch personnel, merchants, community leaders, local government officials -- are thinking. The marketing position in a bank is an ""in-the-field"" job, not just an ""office job.""
OBSERVINGA readily accessible but often underutilized means for keeping up is observation. Observation has several levels. On one level, one simply sees. On another and higher level, one sees and asks ""why?"" It is this higher level of observation that affords so much potential learning.When we walk into McDonald's with our consumer hat on, do we simply see or do we see and ask ourselves ""what can be learned from McDonald's about running a bank?"" When we take our children to Disney World do we simply see or do we ask ""how do they get their people to be so cheerful and friendly?"" When we enter a Hyatt Hotel property do we simply see or do we ask ""what can be learned from this company about using architecture as part of the marketing mix?""In our everyday life as consumers, corporate strategies unfold before our very eyes. We live in a marketing laboratory flush with active experimentation and innovation. But do we take full advantage of the opportunity? Do we truly follow George Rieder's Uncle Albert's advice and ""Steal with our eyes?"" If we don't, we should. It's good advice. High-level observing can contribute to high-level learning.
FINAL THOUGHTThe essence of bank marketing -- or any type of marketing for that matter --is the satisfaction of human needs within a market in a manner sufficient enough that the desired level of demand from the market is realized. This is not a simple matter because of the constancy of change within and about the market. Customers change. Competitors change. Regulation changes. Technology changes. Economic conditions change. Social conditions change. And so on.To serve the market means to change with the market, to keep up with the market.What bank marketers know today won't be enough tomorrow. Tomorrow will be more complex, more demanding, more competitive. Tomorrow will be tougher. Tomorrow will be different.The most potent tool for preparing for tomorrow is knowledge. The nature of the bank marketing job demands that the bank marketer provide a key set of ""eyes and ears"" for the bank. If not the bank marketer, who? If not now -- in an era of mindboggling change -- when? The nature of the bank marketing job demands that the bank marketer keep up."
Minn. Banking Chief Wants More Outside Directors,The American Banker,"December 7, 1979, Friday","Moreover, a recent survey by his office shows that 100 out of Minnesota's 780 banks have three-man boards -- less than the statutory five-member minimum.In a Nov. 20 letter sent to all state banks, Mr. Pint wrote that composition of bank boards has been an issue ""of increasing concern to bank supervisors,"" and he argued that because of directors' unique role, ""it is important that boards be comprised of directors of independent judgment.""Such independence is questioned whenever the board of directors is dominated by or inclusive of a few controlling stockholders or bank officers,"" Mr. Pint wrote.To retain board objectivity, Mr. Pint recommended that outside directors comprise a majority of the board members.""Desired objectivity is not possible,"" he said. ""When a board is composed of insiders and is very small in number, i.e., three or four individuals who control a majority of the outstanding stock and or are active officers of the bank.""""Therefore, if your bank's board of directors is in the category of being dominated by 'insider' directors, I urge you to expand the board"" by electing qualified outside directors, the Minnesota regulator stated.Mr. Pint, a former Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis officer, who became commissioner nine months ago, said he has had a minimum of reaction to his letter and has received few complaints from state banks.""One president called to say it was none of my business who sat on his board of directors, and that his bank had been run satisfactorily for 30 years and saw no reason to change now,"" Mr. Pint said.The Minnesota commissioner said he reminded the caller, as well as other complainants, that bank directors must realize that a commercial bank is a public institution operated with public funds.In his letter, Mr. Pint wrote that in setting policies and procedures to ensure safety and soundness, a bank board ""must respond to the legitimate interests of depositors, the community served by the bank, and stockholders alike.""Norbert A. McCrady, executive vice president of the Independent Bankers Association of Minnesota, said his group is advising banks to ""respond individually"" to Mr. Pint's ""advisory letter"" by deciding on their own whether to alter the makeup of bank boards.""We are not discouraging banks from adding more outside directors,"" said Mr. McCrady, noting that the regulator lacks statutory authority to compel banks to change their boards.State banks, however, must have a minimum of five members on their boards, he said.Likewise, national banks must also have a minimum of five directors and a maximum of 25, said Kenneth W. Leaf, Minneapolis regional Comptroller of the Currency, in response to an inquiry.Eighty percent of the directors of national banks must also reside in the state or within 50 miles of the banking community. There is no written requirement for outside vs. inside directors, he said.In his letter, Mr. Pint asked that state examiners, during regular examinations, review the situation of increasing the board size to five. They will note, he said, ""exceptions in both the number and the composition of the board of directors.""Please inform me of any decision to change the composition or number of directors if this applies to your bank,"" Mr. Pint concluded."
Wells Encouraging Employees to Direct Outside Volunteer Groups,The American Banker,"November 5, 1979, Monday","The bank says it understands it is the only corporation in the nation to establish such a program, although a nonprofit group in New York has a similar operation working only with Harvard graduates.The bank's new Board of Directors Placement Service hopes to fill a continuing need by nonprofit public service agencies for persons to serve on their boards, said a bank spokeswoman. It is at present considered a pilot program, and confined to San Francisco Bay area employees and agencies.The bank circulated a memo to its employees in early June, explaining the need for directors and the service being offered. About 100 employees have responded and are being brought together in an orientation session Wednesday, said Andrea Gregory, administrative assistant to the bank's corporate responsibility committee.""Through this program we hope to provide an opportunity for employees to contribute their skills, enthusiasm and business expertise to nonprofit organizations at the board of directors level,"" she said.""It is easy for people to become absorbed in a world bounded by their jobs, but there's a whole world outside and there are so many talents needed by the volunteer organizations -- more than just fund raising. We believe this is an effective way for business people to make an meaningful contribution to society by extending themselves beyond their work environment,"" she said.Although the program is open to application to all grade levels of Wells Fargo employee, about half of the 100 attending the orientation session will be of the officer level, and about a third of the total have positions of assistant vice president or higher, she said.wenty-one organizations, representing a wide spectrum of community activities, are taking part in the program and will be supplied with the names and backgrounds of the employees interested in serving as their board members.The groups range from the Berkeley Stage Company, the Community Music Center and the San Francisco Bay Area Dance Coalition, to such organizations as Legal Assistance to the Elderly, San Francisco Lighthouse for the Blind, West Marin Senior Services, and Alameda County Family Planning Forum.At the orientation session, the 100 employees who have expressed interest will be briefed by experts in their fields who will explain such aspects as the legal responsibilities of the boards and their directors, what business skills are sought, what their general duties as directors would be, and their relations to paid staffs of the organizations.Following these briefings, the employees will be given forms on which to confirm their interest in participation in the program. The names of those who are still interested will then be turned over to the appropriate agencies, and it will be up to the agencies to decide whether to ask them to participate on their boards.Wells Fargo states that for the past two years, it has given consideration to a person's previous volunteer experience when interviewing applicants for jobs at the bank."
"Protest Slated on Seamen'S, Stevens Tie",The American Banker,"September 28, 1979, Friday","The corporate campaign section of the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union, which has been trying to organize the textile giant, is planning the demonstration to attempt to pressure E. Virgil Conway, chairman of the $1.6 billion-deposit Seamen's, to resign as a Stevens director.""I will not be influenced by a group of placard-waving radicals trying to tear up the fabric of our society,"" Mr. Conway maintained. He declared he does not plan to resign from the Stevens board.""They've been after us for 18 months and have done a number of things which haven't amounted to much,"" he said, adding that this was an ""anti-establishment attack,"" not a show of concern for southern textile workers. He called the union's campaign against his bank ""a completely phony issue"" and said the group's ""call to arms indicates clearly what this gang is all about.""Ray Rogers, director of Amalgamated's corporate campaign, asserted that ""Mr. Conway is an embarrassment to his bank and the free enterprise system he purports to defend."" The banker. Mr. Rogers said, has ""aided and abetted Stevens' unlawful, anti-union and anti-human rights policies.""The union calls Stevens ""America's number one labor law violator,"" saying that it has ""been found guilty of more National Labor Relations Act violations than any other company in United States history."" In addition, the union charges Stevens pays its 43,000 workers 31% less than the national average manufacturing wage.The demonstration is to consist of two ""mile-long human billboards for justice,"" according to the organizers. The ""billboards"" will be made up of ""hundreds of sign carriers standing side by side,"" with one group in the Wall Street area and the other along Park Avenue in midtown Manhattan. Leaflets will be distributed at the demonstrations as well as at major public transportation stations. Mr. Rogers said leaflets will not be handed out at offices of the bank, for ""we're going for areas of heavy traffic.""Mr. Conway said the bank plans no countereducational program: ""We have very bright customers; they clearly understand there is no connection between Seamen's Bank and J. P. Stevens."" He declined to discuss what, if any, extra security measures the thrift would put in place the day of the demonstration.Amalgamated's corporate campaign attempts to alienate the business community from J. P. Stevens, hoping this will speed organization of Stevens plants in the South, according to Mr. Rogers. The corporate campaign is intended to complement other union efforts, including plant organizing and consumer education.The corporate campaign has drawn considerable attention from the business community, especially last year when, under union pressure, James D. Finley, then chairman of Stevens, and David W. Mitchell, chairman of Avon Products, Inc., and a Stevens director, left the board of the $40.6 billion-asset Manufacturers Hanover Corp., New York.Later Mr. Mitchell also resigned from the Stevens board. Mr. Finley also resigned from the board of New York Life Insurance Co. and R. Manning Brown, chairman of New York Life, resigned from the Stevens board.Observers attribute these resignations to Mr. Rogers and the corporate campaign."
Karmel of SEC Urges Reexamination Of Glass-Steagall Financial Division,The American Banker,"October 15, 1979, Monday","""What we need is a legislative overview of the financial world relevant to today's challenges,"" she told a conference here.""Such an overview may well show that the abuses of the 1920s -- and, in fact, the new abuses that have arisen as a result of changing products and markets --""But,"" she continued, ""the segregation would then be founded on a new legislative determination of the potential harms inherent in existing practices and not on what is increasingly becoming the semantical characterization of securities and the agency-principal dichotomy.""Mrs. Karmel spoke at a conference on the regulation of the securities activities of commercial banks held at the New York University Graduate School of Business Administration. She holds a law degree from NYU.Emphasizing that she was setting forth her personal views and not those of the SEC, she said Glass-Steagall was based on the abuses uncovered in 1933 and 1934 by Ferdinand Pecora when he was counsel to the Senate Banking and Currency Committee in its investigation of stock exchange, banking and securities market practices.""Those abuses occurred in an era of booming equities markets,"" she said. ""If banks had been involved instead in REITs or forward contracts on financial instruments when the crash came, the Glass- Steagall Act might have been drafted differently.""As it was, Mrs. Karmel said, Congress concluded that commercial banks must divorce themselves from their securities affiliates.""Like so much New Deal legislation, it was a reactive and pragmatic response to specific perceived wrongs,"" she said. ""The statute puts restraints on certain banking activities, rather than enunciating a broad, philosophical rationale for dividing a formerly homogeneous financial community into two subcultures.""But, she said, the Glass-Steagall Act --and the ideas currently set forth for amending it -- do not even address, much less answer, the fundamental questions of national policy in the regulation of financial institutions.Mrs. Karmel listed five such issues:What regulation is necessary to protect investors in securities transactions and depositors at commercial banks?How much concentration of power and wealth in financial institutions is in the public interest?To what extent should the government control allocation of financial resources?What conflicts by fiduciaries should be prohibited because they impair confidence in financial markets?Assuming a consensus can be reached on any of these issues, what legislation will best achieve the objectives of financial institution regulation?The SEC commissioner said Glass-Steagall was not intended to shield any segment of the financial community against competition.""Rather, Congress intended to protect the public and the American economy against the banking abuses uncovered by Ferdinand Pecora. And if the separation of commercial and investment banking is to be reaffirmed today, it should be because there is an ongoing need for such protection or there are new public needs that have arisen as a result of changes in the financial industry.""Mrs. Karmel quoted Mr. Pecora as saying he had found ""a shocking corruption in our banking system, a widespread repudiation of old-fashioned standards of honesty and fair dealing in the creation and sale of securities, and a merciless exploitation of the vicious possibilities of intricate corporate chicanery.""To which she ad libbed this comment: ""People seem to save that rhetoric today only for the government."""
Bill Hiking Mtge. Ceiling for Federal S&Ls Gains,The American Banker,"September 27, 1979, Thursday","The bill now goes to the House Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs for consideration.The bill, approved by the subcommittee on financial institutions supervision, regulation and insurance, also would reduce S&L insurance reserve requirements from a present 5% of total savings deposits to 4%.The legislation, known as the Depository Institutions Act of 1979, also authorizes the Comptroller of the Currency to extend by five years the current five-year period during which national banks may hold real estate. This would apply only to real estate owned prior to June 30, 1979.Extensions now may be granted if the bank shows that it has made a real attempt to dispose of the real estate in the original five-year period, or that disposal of that real estate within that period would have been detrimental to the bank.The bill received only minor revisions before it was passed by voice vote by the subcommittee.An amendment ordering a Federal Home Loan Bank Board study of mortgage issues, to be completed within six months of enactment of the act, was proposed by Rep. Jerry M. Patterson, D., Calif., and was accepted unanimously.The study would focus on the impact of mortgage loan ceilings on mortgage lending activities of Federal S&Ls and Federal mutual savings banks.It would also attempt to determine the ability of secondary market institutions, under mortgage loan ceilings, to provide liquidity to those institutions.The study would include suggested alternatives to statutorily imposed conventional mortgage loan ceilings and recommendations for legislative or administrative actions considered appropriate by the FHLBB.Testimony and comments received by the subcommittee prior to the vote endorsed the increased mortgage loan amount ceiling.A letter from the National Savings and Loan League suggested that limits on mortgage lending be repealed altogether.""In those areas where most or all of the mortgage demand is for $80,000 to $100,000 homes, the Federal savings and loan is obliged by CRA (Community Reinvestment Act) to 'meet the credit needs of their community' but is severely restricted in doing so by an arbitrary mortgage limit,"" the letter said.A letter from the United States League of Savings Association expressed the same concern.The American Bankers Association, in a letter, recommended allowing a national bank to get an extension to sell its property regardless of when the property was purchased.""We believe,"" the ABA letter said, ""that the use of any single date, as proposed in the bill, is unnecessary and undesirable.""Rep. D. Douglas Barnard Jr., D., Ga., proposed an amendment to delete the June 30 date from the bill. It was defeated by a 8-6 vote.Jay Janis, chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, testified earlier this week that he supported the reduction of insurance reserve requirements but that such a move would do little more than provide temporary relief to some savings and loans."
Rhode Island,The American Banker,"April 19, 1979, Thursday",
One of Carter's Tasks Is to Convince Financial Lobbies of Energy's Priority,The American Banker,"July 20, 1979, Friday","Not the savings rate differential; not dwindling membership in the Federal Reserve System; not preservation of interest paying transaction accounts; but energy.In his Sunday night speech, Mr. Carter complained that too often Congress was incapable of action because it was ""twisted and pulled in every direction by hundreds of well-financed and powerful special interests.""The lobbies representing banks, thrift institutions and credit unions are only several among the hundreds, but they are a pretty good example of what the President meant.Few reporters seeking a candid appraisal of Mr. Carter's energy proposals this week contacted the financial trade associations for an on-the-record statement because they knew what they would get -- a cautiously worded essay complimenting the President for his initiative, but also extolling the virtues of additional study of these ideas.It is the kind of thing that would irritate neither the White House nor Republican critics because this is the way the lobbies do business.Passage of special interest bills favoring financial institutions nearly always depend on both Republican and Democratic votes so the object is to stay on the good side of both. Even in dealing with the most crucial of national issues, the strategy is determined by how it will affet one's own narrow concerns.Again, this is not unique to the banks, thrift institutions or credit unions. Labor, business, consumerists, farmers, all head into the fray with elbows cocked to get what they can for themselves.However, of these groups, the financial lobbies represent the sector which may be most affected by the awesome challenge facing our society.The need is for a restructuring of American technology without precededent in peace time. This national effort cannot succeed without a massive mobilization of economic resources, and the know-how for this kind of mobilization is in the financial community.President Carter's blueprint for energy independence includes two financing mechanisms which look good on the drawing board. But the test is whether these concepts will work in the marketplace. And no one can counsel with more perception on this than those who are there every day.The whole idea of recruiting special interest power in a national effort for change is itself out of character with traditional political experience because more often than not the role of the lobby is to preserve the status quo to keep intact current advantage.It is difficult to see how the present emergency can ever pass if this does not change.Above all, what is needed almost instantly is enough courage and patriotism to deal clinically with what is likely to be the most important national issue for the remainder of the century.For the financial community, this could mean a trip to the White House by a banker someday to tell Mr. CArter, or some future President, without regard for how it could affect interest rate ceilings, or bank regulation,. . . ""Mr. President, with all due respects, whay you are proposing is stupid.""Mr. Carter needs this kind of cooperation. So does the country."
Panel Skeptics Seek Rationale On Underwriting,The American Banker,"June 27, 1979, Wednesday","Opening a hearing on legislation that would permit banks to enter that market, subcommittee chairman Fernand J. St Germain, D., R.I., set the tone for the questioning.""During the course of these hearings we will hear much about competition and lower costs in the underwriting of municipal securities,"" he said. ""As members of this subcommittee are aware, there is a wide disparity in the claims and counterclaims of cost savings. Choose your own academic.""But at the outset, let me make it clear that this subcommittee is solidly behind apple pie, the American flag, motherhood, lower costs and more competition. Not all may agree, however, that the route to the land of apple pie and lower-cost financing lies through the boardrooms of the nation's commercial banks,"" he added.Four Representatives, Gladys Noon Spellman, D., Md.; Norman Y. Mineta, D., Calif.; Benjamin A. Gilman, R., N.Y. and Nicholas Mavroules, D., Mass., testified in support of the bill, which was introduced by Rep. Spellman.More than $30 billion municipal revenue bonds were issued in 1978, accounting for more than 60% of all new long-term municipal financing.Rep. Mineta told the subcommittee of the House Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs Committee that as more states consider spending limits similar to Proposition 13 that California passed last year, the trend toward issuing revenue bonds will increase.Rep. James M. Hanley, D., N.Y., was the first rank-and-file subcommittee member to challenge the supporters' view.Calling the securities ""a hidden tax"" he added, ""My concern is, should we be increasing municipal use of revenue bonds in the face of taxpayer resistance?""I appreciate your comments, but we're still playing a bit of a shell game with the taxpayer,"" he said.Rep. John J. Cavanaugh, D., Neb., added that he was concerned that large, money-center banks would dominate the market and local interests if new powers were allowed.Citing the Community Reinvestment Act and other Federal antiredlining laws, Rep. James A. Mattox, D., Texas, said, ""It concerns me that you are asking us to expand their (bank) powers when they are not meeting their responsibilities to the small consumer and small businesses.""Rep. Spellman replied, ""We're really trying to get the best deal for our jurisdictions as we can and we're not trying to excuse the banks.""Rep. Gilman added, ""We're here not to condone those errors of judgment of the past, but to allow the banks to do something good for the community.""Legislation to allow bank municipal revenue underwriting powers was first introduced 15 years ago.Rep. Spellman alone has introduced such a bill three times in recent years.Opponents of the bill, primarily from the securities industry, will testify before the subcommittee Wednesday. A third day of hearings is planned but not scheduled.The subcommittee is holding the hearings in connection with legislation it is considering that would change bank holding company laws."
Appeals Court Bars Regulators from Authorizing Share Drafts,The American Banker,"April 23, 1979, Monday","Financial institutions would have to halt offering these services after Jan. 1, 1980, unless Congress acts in the interim.The court said that Federal regulatory agencies had exceeded their legal authority in allowing the financial institutions those transaction accounts.The three-judge panel had heard arguments on the three cases only three weeks ago. The order shows that they agreed unanimously that laws on the books have not kept up with financial innovations.""This court is convinced that the methods of transfer authorized by the agency regulations have outpaced the methods and technology of fund transfer authorized by the existing statutes,"" the opinion read.The judges noted that share drafts, ATS, and remote service units were authorized by their particular agencies in order to gain competitive advantages or equity with other financial institutions.""The net result has been that three separate and distinct types of financial institutions created by Congressional enactment to serve different public needs have now become, or are rapidly becoming, three separate but homogeneous types of financial institutions offering virtually identibal services to the public, all without the benefit of Congressional consideration and statutory enactment,"" the court said.The opinion makes clear that the judges could not make the policy judgment of whether the new services are in the public interest.""Therefore, we have no option but to set aside the regulations authorizing such funds transfers as being in violation of statute,"" the three-judge panel said.They acknowledged in their order that some financial institutions have invested heavily in installation of the new technology. The effect of this ""would have a deleterious impact on the financial community as a whole in the absence of the certainty that new procedures are authorized for the foreseeable future which certainty only a Congressional enactment can give,"" according to the opinion.The circuit court panel consisted of Judges Carl McGowan, Malcolm Richard Wilkie and Edward A. Tamm.The decision is a major victory for the Independent Bankers Association of America, which had opposed all three financial services on the grounds that they were contrary to Congressional intent.In one brief submitted to the panel, the IBAA had said the courts should consider the three cases together. ""This self-serving move toward homogenization of financial institutions is clearly contrary to past and present Congressional intent,"" the community bank trade group had argued.It was not known Friday whether any of the three regulators would appeal the circuit decision to the Supreme Court.One caveat in the decision is that the court said the decision was not to be used as precedent in other cases.Lower courts in each of the three appeals cases had previously upheld the legality of the financial service innovations allowed by the particular Federal regulator.The first case involved the United States League of Savings Associations' challenge of bank regulatory approval of ATS.The second case was brought by the IBAA against the Federal Home Loan Bank Board over whether the agency had the legal authority to permit Federal S&Ls to operate off-premise electronic terminals.The last case was an American Bankers Association suit against the National Credit Union Administration questioning its legal authority to allow Federal credit unions to offer check-like share drafts."
Priorities at Home-II,The American Banker,"March 14, 1979, Wednesday","For example, traveling officers often find that the individual bankers they visit have no estate plan, have no real investment program for themselves, even if they do have a fine one for their banks, and in many other ways have really followed the old adage ""the shoemaker's children go barefoot."" In short, there is a great opportunity for the correspondent banker to make his points with the respondent bank and win friends and overcome fears by helping with these personal matters.Those who have been visiting community banks from the investment community have found long ago that they have as good an opportunity selling bonds to the bankers as individuals as they have selling them to the banks for the banks' portfolios.And those investment people who work with thrift executives especially have found that they have a real opportunity to help these individuals handle their personal financial problems at the same time as they visit to help the thrift.But correspondents have a more difficult job than investment people in helping individuals. For the investment salesman knows that if he helps the banker or thrift executive with his personal finances and financial affairs, he will be rewarded with commission business that the banker or thrift executive pays for himself.The correspondent banker is in a ticklish position, however. He must be scrupulous in insuring that advice and assistance to the respondent banker personally be clearly part of a program that brings business directly to the correspondent bank's trust department or as an adjunct to full service for the bank, not compensated through balances.The correspondent banker in this situation also should be doubly conscious of the dangers of imparting insider information.If the correspondent is successful, he will ethically have helped the respondent deal with his personal financial situation, helping him devote more time to the bank's performance.It is this prosperity, after all, that both the correspondent and the respondent are trying to achieve through the entire relationship.One could add that gaining this service is as much of value to the bank as is a medical plan that lets officers and employees think of bank business full time and not have to worry about the implications of illness at the expense of their efficiency on the job.But most important, if a correspondent banker has the skill to help the respondent banker with his personal affairs and do a good job here, he not only personalizes the relationship and makes it closer than ever, he also has the opportunity to show his expertise in finance.This in turn allays all fears that the respondent is serving as the place where the novice makes his mistakes before he is put to work on his own bank's business.For when the correspondent-respondent relationship gets so close that the correspondent is asked for personal financial help as well as bank help, there is no doubt left in any one's mind but that the traveling officer is a true professional not just a trainee."
Bank Groups Mobilize on CRA,The American Banker,"April 5, 1979, Thursday","Mr. Hope, who is vice chairman of the $1.7 billion-deposit First Union National Bank, Charlotte, N.C., spoke at a director-management conference here sponsored by the New Jersey Bankers Association. He elaborated on his remarks in an interview later.The other organizations working with the ABA, he said, are the Bank Administration Institute, Rober Morris Associates, National Association of Bank Women, Association of Bank Holding Companies, the Conference of State Banking Supervisors, and the Consumer Bankers Association.Mr. Hope said that representatives of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Federal Reserve Board, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. attended the meeting at which the questionnaires were suggested.Mr. Hope said that ""emotional appeals"" to repeal that act are ""the worst thing.""""We need horror stories,"" he said, adding that Congress and bank regulators ""want to know why"" the act should be repealed.Mr. Hope said that bankers should ""do their homework"" on how the act is operating and report ""on examples of abuses"" when answering the questionnaires.The ABA president-elect told the New Jersey bankers that the strategy was developed at a meeting in Washington March 29 called by the ABA.He said that drafts of the questionnaires are expected to be completed by April 15, and to be sent to organization members around May 1.He said that another meeting of the ad hoc bankers group probably would be called at the end of May to summarize the results of the questionnaires for presentations to Congress and bank regulators.Two state banking groups have formally called for a repeal of the CRA. The executive committee of the N.J. Bankers Association took the action about two weeks ago, following the lead of the Pennsylvania Bankers Association whose president, Harold F. Still Jr., sharply criticized the legislation.Mr. Still is chairman and chief executive officer of Central Penn National Corp., parent of Central Penn National Bank, Philadelphia.Mr. Hope cited an example of problems caused by the CRA. A bank in the Midwest had been told by an examiner to go four miles from its office to define its community although a river two miles from the office was the natural boundary of its trading area.Angelo R. Bianchi, New Jersey Commissioner of Banks, told the conference that a decline in capital to asset ratios of state-chartered commercial banks was "" rather disturbing.""He said that the ratio has declined from 9.2% at yearend 1975 to 8.8% in 1976, to 8.4% in 1977 and 7.8% in 1978. He noted that last year's decline of 0.6 percentage points was substantially larger than in the two previous years.""The commissioner said that the pending receipt of the remainder of the department's evaluation run are completed. ""I am not in a position to say what supervisory action I will be taking if any,"" he said.""Certainly,"" he said, ""I will deter any bank that is low in capital, weak in earnings or negative in any other respects from growth through branching or merging."""
Foreign Investment Opportunities Burgeon As Developing Nations' Economies Grow,The American Banker,"October 22, 1979, Monday","Consider a few aspects of the ""market profile"" alone. The more than 100 nations which make up the developing world contain more than two-thirds of the earth's entire population, and by the year 2000 their numbers will reach a projected five billion; if you have any doubts about their growth potential, consider the fact that in 1968, they accounted for about $10 billion in U.S. exports - just 10 years later, that figure had risen to more than $50 billion.These countries are now our fastest growing markets, and they also represent a growing source of vital industrial economic growth in the years ahead. Acceleration of their economic development is, therefore, very much in the U.S. national interest, and particularly important to the interest of U.S. business. Their growth will create new and more diversified outlets for our goods and services - but they will do so only if we rise to the challenge of fierce competition from Japan, Germany, France, Great Britain and other industrialized nations.Any assessment of how we will fare in this battle for the markets of the future calls for some thought on where we have been and where we stand today. And, as you probably know, our current position is a far cry from the once dominant place we held in international trade. In 1968, for example, the U.S. share of the world export market stood at a whopping 23.5%, but in 1978 that share of market had dwindled to 14% and we ranked sixth among the major exporting nations, a loss that accounts for about one-half of our trade deficit.At this point, the question arises, ""What do we do about it? How do we regain that competitive edge? How can smaller companies take advantage of these opportunities?""There are two major areas for the businessman, large or small, to think about - export and private foreign investment. We need to expand in both and the U.S. government is prepared to help by providing services which help to minimize the risks involved.Traditionally, of course, the international marketplace has been viewed as a sort of private game preserve for the huge multinational corporations whose financial strength and management resources allow them to assume the unusual risks involved in doing business abroad, particularly in the developing countries. In the aggregate, about 100 large companies account for half of all U.S. exports and a total of 250 companies account for 75%. About a third of all our exports go from U.S. corporations to their own foreign affiliates and branches, a fact which points up the key role played by investment in stimulating trade.But it is the potential of literally thousands of smaller U.S. companies with the capability to enter international markets that constitutes our ace-in-the-hole for the 1980s, and the time to explore these opportunities is now. In short, we must broaden our base significantly.Many overseas market and investment opportunities are simply not practical for the big corporations which are not geared to undertake projects with relatively small sales potential, but someone will recognize that potential and the U.S. has a good chance to take the lead. The government recognizes that the decision to enter the world marketplace is not a simple one, but a good many of the problems encountered in export and investment abroad can be reduced by taking advantage of the services offered to U.S. private sector investors in the developing countries by the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, the Export-Import Bank, the U.S. Department of Commerce, and the Small Business Administration, which have broadened their services with the aim of improving the chances for smaller companies contemplating overseas operations.
Foreign InvestmentDuring recent months, there has been a great deal of attention focused on strengthening the U.S. export position, and it should be emphasized that private investment abroad is a key factor in the generation of U.S. exports, but its role is far more extensive than that. U.S. private investors have made major contributions to the growth of the economies of the emerging nations of Asia, Africa, the Middle East, Latin America, and several nations in Europe. These nations will continue to grow only if they attract and mobilize the productive kind of investment that strengthens the private sector, creates new jobs, teaches new skills, generates tax revenues and produces goods for local consumption and export.At the same time, this type of foreign investment produces significant benefits for the U.S. economy by creating job opportunities, developing new outlets for our goods and returning a positive contribution to our balance of payments.It is the job of the Overseas Private Investment corporation, a self-sustaining agency, to encourage the kind of investment that brings mutual benefit to the host country and the U.S. economy, and, at the same time, provides the businessman with the chance to expand into new and profitable markets. It does this through two principal programs. One provides political risk insurance against the contingencies of expropriation (nationalization); inconvertibility - the inability to convert local currencies into dollars; and physical damage to plant and equipment caused by a war, revolution, or insurrection. The other offers financial services, principally to smaller businesses, in the form of direct loans of up to $5 million, loan guarantees of up to $50 million, and the partial funding of feasibility studies prior to the investment decision.OPIC does not support ""runaway"" projects designed to take advantage of cheap labor, or which may have an adverse effect on the U.S. economy, nor will it participate in the establishment of such ventures as gambling casinos or munitions factories - but there are plenty of opportunities left. As a service to those thinking about foreign investment, OPIC has established a special small business ""Hot Line,"" 800-424-OPIC, and a toll-free call can produce information both about the programs available and the potential opportunities.In formulating legislation to extend OPIC's insurance and guaranty authority through September 30, 1981, Congress specifically directed that the corporation undertake special efforts to help smaller businesses (defined as those companies not ranked in the ""Fortune 1000"" industrial list) enter the international field. In line with the legislation, OPIC uses its direct lending authority to encourage investment projects sponsored by smaller businesses or cooperatives, and loans can be made for as little as $50,000 or go as high as $5 million, depending on the factors involved.Second, Congress indicated that OPIC should try to achieve a level of 30% of the number of small business projects insured or financed in fiscal 1978; 32% of the insurance projects involved smaller business and 86% of the finance projects were in this category. This is significant in that it indicates growing interest in foreign markets and increasing confidence on the part of the small business community that it can compete successfully in the international area.Third, the legislation authorized OPIC to, in effect, subsidize pre-investment and finance services by using some of the profits generated by insurance and guarantees.In response to the legislation, OPIC has undertaken many initiatives to educate the small business community about the potential opportunities of overseas investment, and has broken much new ground which eventually will lead to the entry of many of these companies into the international marketplace. As a beginning, its programs and policies were broadened considerably to provide a number of preferences to smaller businesses.By way of educating these companies to the potentials of international investment, OPIC undertook co-sponsorship of a series of export and investment seminars with the Export-Import Bank, the Department of Commerce and the Small Business Administration. To date, meetings have been held in more than 50 cities in the United States and total attendance has been in excess of 12,000 small and minority businessmen and women. The ""Hot Line"" generates an average of 175 to 200 calls a month, and special literature has been produced on small business services. Copies of these publications and other literature may be obtained by contacting the information officer, OPIC, 1129 Twentieth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20527, or calling on the ""Hot Line"" (800-424-OPIC).A new avenue to the small business world has been opened through a combined loan-grant program designed to help private voluntary organizations which make small loans to very small businesses in various areas of the world. For example, a loan of $500,000 and a grant of $150,000 to the Witherspoon Development Corporation of New York will support the extension of its program for small business in the Caribbean area.Another example is the Institute for International Development of Vienna, Virginia, which received an OPIC loan and grant of $125,000 in 1978. IIDI has field offices in Kenya, Indonesia, Colombia and Honduras, and in just a year has made supportive loans averaging $7,400 to 26 projects.Yet another avenue to small business is a special incentive program for insurance brokers and agents, under which OPIC pays commissions for political risk policies issued to small business customers. Obviously, this helps to reach into communities all over the country and to establish contact with potential investors who may be unaware of the opportunities available.OPIC has also played an active role in the White House Conference on Small Business and has held a number of its own seminars on investment in the developing countries.Under its investment mission program, OPIC takes groups of U.S. business executives to various developing countries throughout the world to provide them with the chance to meet directly with foreign government officials, U.S. embassy personnel and local businessmen interested in the possibility of joint ventures. The program is self-sustaining in that the executives pay their own way, but it has gained considerable approval because it provides immediate access to key people both in government and the private sector.During the past several months, groups have visited Southeast Asia and the Sudan, and a mission is currently visiting Greece, Yugoslavia and Turkey. Planning for 1980 missions to Egypt, Israel, Sri Lanka and the Dominican Republic is already under way.It should be made clear, however, that while the corporation has undertaken many initiatives to facilitate the entry of smaller companies into the international field, its Congressional mandate does not exclude larger corporations which traditionally have led the way in the area of overseas investment.
The Banking CommunitySince its inception, OPIC has worked closely with financial institutions to generate new private investment in the developing countries, and to a large degree, the success of the effort to compete effectively in the 1980s will depend on the continuance of their pivotal role in the investment process.With their financial and management resources, their flexibility in adapting to changing situations, and their expertise in gathering and evaluating information, they enter the investment and developmental processes at many levels. At the start of the process, they can provide the investor with an analysis of the investment climate in a given country, provide support financing and guidance to other available services.Banks also provide support for host country development banks and play a key role in teaching banking techniques and methods to help strengthen the nation's financial infrastructure. Many leading banks have established branches in the developing nations and these not only provide important services for local projects but help U.S. investors to purchase needed equipment and materials, often providing a stimulus to U.S. exports. OPIC has insured investment in many of these branches and looks forward to strengthening these ties in the future.Thus, the public and private sectors, working in partnership, can play an increasingly important part in strengthening the hand of the U.S. businessman in international markets.The years ahead will produce great challenges and great opportunities, and neither the U.S. business community nor the government can afford to ignore them.The U.S. government is prepared to offer many kinds of assistance because it recognizes that in an increasingly interdependent world that the businessman in Bangkok is just as much our next-door neighbor as the executive in Boston, and that we must maintain our competitive position to build new markets and to sustain our own rate of growth.It has not been our history to back off from either challenge or opportunity and it seems unlikely that the American business community will have a sudden change of heart in the face of what lies ahead.Picture, J.

"BHC, Ariz. Bank Join Rockies ATM Net",The American Banker,"February 13, 1979, Tuesday","Witnesses representing the Illinois Bankers Association and the Independent Community Banks in Illinois told the Illinois Electronic Funds Transfer Study Commission that its proposed legislative package goes too far in permitting banks to install shared off premised automated teller machines and point-of-sale machines in retail locations.The state commission issued for comment last month a proposal allowing banks to establish up to four automated teller installations in contiguous counties and permitting banks to deploy an unlimited number of POS devices.Criticizing the commission package at a hearing here last week, B. F. Backland, president of the Illinois BA, said consumer demand for electronic banking services in Illinois remains absent.""Granted it is the hope of the banking community that at some future time we can convince our customers to use electronic transfers,"" Mr. Backlund, said. ""However, this desire for a checkless society may have caught on some with bankers but it is as yet to capture the imagination of the consumer.""Mr. Backlund, who also is president of the $16 million-deposit Bartonville Bank, said the general public is just now starting to use direct deposit of payroll but the response has been slow.""For three years the United States Treasury has been promoting a direct electronic deposit program for recipients of government checks,"" but Treasury data show response in Illinois has been 21.9%, he said.""We see no overwhelming demand by the people of Illinois to move into the full-blown world of EFT.Arthur R. Murray, a past president of ICBI and president of the $16.8 million-deposit Citizens State Bank, Milford, told the panel that independent bankers ""cannot support any provision permitting an unlimited number of functions at the point of sale.""Moreover, ICBI objects to the concept of sharing ATM equipment and deployment of the devices beyond two miles from a main office.""Lastly, ICBI recommends that additional regulatory teeth be placed into this proposal,"" Mr. Murray urged. ""While we have no definitive regulatory procedure to offer, we do believe that the Commissioner of Banks and Trust Companies should possess some regulatory authority over deployment and pricing.""In his testimony, Mr. Backlund suggested that some Illinois banks are using EFT as a smokescreen to alter the state's antibranching law.""Who is pushing for far-reaching EFTs legislation?"" Mr. Backlund asked. ""We presume it must be those who would like to see revolutionary change in the banking structure of Illinois, those who would hope to use an undisciplined entry into EFT to gain additional market share regardless of the lack of public demand or the high costs of installation and operation of these systems.""It was uncertain what impact the testimony of the Illinois BA AND ICBI would have on state lawmakers when they take up EFT legislation in March or April.A majority of the 15-member commission has been eager to put together a liberal EFT package and during months of hearings and debate has frequently clashed with banking representatives who have urged a minimum of EFT installations."
"CofC Issues 1st CRA Denial, Bars Merger of Indiana Bank",The American Banker,"November 30, 1979, Friday","The Comptrollers' Office denied a merger of Bank of Indiana NA, Gary, into ""Indiana Interim National Bank,"" Gary. The acquisition by Interim, a shell corporation, would have enabled the $269.9 million-asset Money Management Corp., Chicago, to buy the remaining 0.7% of the shares of Bank of Indiana which it does not own.The order of denial said the $223.6 million -- deposit Bank of Indiana made unsatisfactory efforts to ascertain credit needs of downtown Gary and that its loan requirements and underwriting practices discriminated against minorities and low-income groups.The order also said that its pattern of loans showed a disparity between high-income and low-income areas and that the bank continued violations of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act even after violations were cited in examinations.In a related action, however, the Comptroller reluctantly approved the moving of a Bank of Indiana branch made without the agency's approval.Disapproval otherwise would have meant the closing of the branch because the new location is far superior to the old one, which is no longer available for lease. Keeping the branch open was in the public interest, the order said.But the order said the move under other conditions would have been disapproved for CRA reasons.Reached by phone Thursday in Gary, Michael S. Zonakis, executive vice president for the bank, said the institution's board Thursday approved a letter to Comptroller John G. Heimann contesting the allegations in the denial order and inviting the office to make another examination of the bank.The denial is based upon an examination last Feb. 12 which occurred seven days after the deadline to have available a CRA statement, Mr. Zonakis said. The bank had difficulty knowing what documentation was expected and what the CRA required of the bank.He said that because the bank was one of the first to be examined with CRA in effect, it has suffered from a lack of time with which to bring itself into compliance. He said the bank has made several changes which the denial order does not take into account.The agency has not provided the bank with specifics on which it based its judgment and Mr. Zonakis said he does not have ""a nickel's worth"" of information on which loan denials were objectionable. He said he is not aware of the ECOA violations.The order said the bank's failure to meet CRA criteria in some areas could have been offset by positive actions in other areas, but that the bank had made only uncertain commitments to CRA action.These included the appointment of a vice president for Gary affairs and a commitment to make $10 million in credit available over the next five years for downtown qualified borrowers after completion of a civic center complex and downtown U.S. Steel tower. The bank also showed a willingness to particiate in a housing rehabilitation program.But the order said the promised $10 million in credit was subject to ""extensive contingencies"" and that the bank had not made a firm commitment to the housing program.The order said further that policy changes at a bank compensate for poor past CRA performance only if ""they are of a significant magnitude, and have been in effect long enough to demonstrate that they are already strengthening the bank's performance.""""It must be emphasized once again that token improvements or policy changes undertaken immediately prior to or during submission of an application cannot be construed as constituting good-faith compliance with the spirit of CRA,"" the order said.The order said that the bank could have initiated discussions with Gary residents and business to ascertain credit needs and advertised services to all population segments.Mr. Zonakis said his bank has been doing just that.He said the bank has initiated numerous discussion meetings with community groups and has made hundreds of phone calls to all area residents to inform them of services.He said the bank frequently advertises in the Gary Post-Tribune, northwest Indiana's largest daily paper, and in Gary Info and the Gary Defender, two weeklies directed at predominantly black readerships. The bank also advertises on WWCA radio in Gary and WLPH, a predominantly black station in Gary.The bank also advertises on WMPP in East Chicago Heights, another black station. ""Why would I go over to Illinois if I wasn't interested in black audiences?"" he said.The Comptroller also took issue with the bank's actions in January, 1978, to require 30% down payments, high compensating balances and interest rates two points above market. These discriminate against lower income groups, the order said.Mr. Zonakis said the bank was obviously withdrawing from the mortgage market. The bank wanted to shift its portfolio into short-term securities due to uncertainty over interest rates, he said.A minimum dwelling floor size of 990 square feet for mortgages, objected to by the agency, has been dropped, Mr. Zonakis said. The restriction was designed to cut down administrative costs.The denial is the second CRA denial of an application. The first was an Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. denial of a branch application from the $1.5 billion-deposit Greater New York Savings Bank, Brooklyn, on grounds that the bank was not meeting community credit needs.But the FDIC said that a continuation of the bank's improved performance in committing mortgage funds to Brooklyn could allow a favorable CRA assessment ""possibly in early 1980."""

A Thoughtful Approach to Marketing a New Moniker,The American Banker,"August 22, 1979, Wednesday","Much work has gone into staging the ceremony. Out of it will come the name for this new carrier. It's a matter of which of the two airlines' names will come first. But the cost is minimal -- only the $40 fee it took to rent a 1903 $20 gold piece.The bigwigs of both airlines are assembled. A high school band strikes up the respective tunes of each airline. The coin is in the air. A call is made. The new name for the airline? Western-Continental! Huh?I'll say this uncategorically, there is nothing more important a company, a bank or holding company can do than to be wise, calculating and thoughtful about changing it's name. My gut feeling is that ""Western-Continental"" underestimated the power of the current image of the single name ""Continental"" in its deliberations. Of course, it's a moot point now that negotiations are terminated.On the other hand, another airline, ""Allegheny,"" may have struck oil in its approach to a name change with U.S. Airline, a New name repositioning Allegheny from a regional carrier to one intended to make a national impact on the markets it wants to serve.As mergers become prevelent in the banking industry, as inter/intrastate banking becomes a reality, bank marketers must provide counsel and leadership in the area of naming our flotilla of market entities.
Dangers of Changing a NameChanging the name of a corporation is not as easy as one would think. A corporation's identity and image stems from its name, and the discarding of an old one and selection of a new one is a most serious business. You have to remember that your bank name has created an impression of some kind on not only the consumers in your trade community but also the commercial and trust communities you serve, and most importantly the financial analyst community. What kind of impressions have you created within those communities? What impact would a name change cause within each? And if you do change names, which one will assist you best in creating the image you want for your company? All of these critical questions require research to answer them, and only after the research is done, and properly analyzed, can you be sure of the steps you need to take to accomplish this task.To perform this task properly, you need to answer the following key question:1. Where are you now? What is the image of the bank, holding company and affiliates, and what role does the current name(s) play in the structure of that image?2. Where do you want to go? What image does the bank, holding company want for itself and its affiliates? How can a name change for itself and/or its subsidiaries assist in the creation of that image goal?3. How do you get there?What steps do you need to take in accomplishing this effort?4. How do you know when you get there? What kind of control and monitoring devices are needed to help keep you on the path you select?Once you have answers to these questions, you will have a plan for going about this task. To underestimate a name change without such a plan would invite an ill-conceived decision process which would increase the risk of selecting a poor name with all the resulting adversity.So this will take time to do right. You need some research, some thinking, and perhaps more imprtantly, a commitment from top management to not only the task, but to doing it right.
Arguments Against ChangeJust as there are some good reasons why we should change corporate identities, there are some arguments against such a move.Longevity of Current Names -- Especially in a holding company environment you have to remember that many of your banks have had their current name for a significant number of years. Many of your banks have grown up with their communities and the people in those towns have come to know and identify with them as they are now named. A change in names could cause a break in a long-standing relationship.Anti-Holding Company of Big Business Feelings -- Like it or not a name change can connote a ""takeover"" or lack of community involvement. Here, again, is the importance of research. You can ask a series of questions about people's feelings toward and willingness to use holding company banks vs. independent banks. Via analysis, you can determine each market's receptiveness to the concept of ""affiliated"" banks. You can analyze how customers and non-customers of each of the member banks alighn themselves regarding holding company vs. independent bank usage.You can analyze which outlying markets, both customers and non-customers, state a preference for doing business with an independent bank over a holding company bank, or vice-versa. This raises an interesting speculation over what would happen in those markets if you change the bank's name so as to reflect a holding company tie-in. Loss of Business? Declining Profits? This is one area that deserves a great deal of attention and study.Lack of Market Knowledge -- Of Customer Benefits of Affiliation you will find that the largest percentage of respondents in each market vote ""no preference."" You might conclude this is possibly due to their lack of knowledge about the concept ""Bank Affiliation."" If this is so, either you would have to undertake a sizable educational campaign explaining the concept of Affiliation and stressing the advantages of same, or any name change undertaken to present an unified local front could have no impact at all.Thus, the possibility exists that in some markets, a name change could cause negative results due to an Independent Bank preference, while in others it could cause no change at all. Either result is unfavorable.Reversal of Past Policy -- It is possible that a name change of any degree could be a signal to those banks of a change in that operating philosophy, in spite of assurances to the contrary. If such a reading is made by them, what would that do to employee morale and leadership within each bank? Such a move could backfire for this reason if nothing else.Trauma -- Many bank marketing directors will tell you the biggest problem when asked to describe the experience, is that they frequently use the word ""traumatic."" By doing so, they were referring to the emotional aspect, suffered by bank employees, of giving up the banks' individual names. The reaction of employees can be extremely negative and, as mentioned before, can defeat the entire program. I cannot stress this point too much.Cost -- My final point concerns the cost of such a program. We are not talking about just a few signage changes and perhaps a few new ads, but a complete long-term marketing effort. Such an effort would not only improve advertising, but personnel, training, marketing research, and P.R. as well. Do not underestimate the costs for this project.A name change project will not be cheap nor will it take just a short time to implement. The question is: ""Is it worth it?"""

CRA Protest Set On Michigan Bid,The American Banker,"August 23, 1979, Thursday","The Michigan application is one of four protested applications currently pending at the Federal Reserve Board. No CRA-protested applications are pending at the other three banking agencies in Washington, according to a check at the agencies.The Detroit-based committee has asked the Fed to require adoption of an affirmative plan in the event that it approves the Michigan National application.Otherwise, the committee said, the application should be denied because: Michigan National banks possess a poor lending record in low- and moderate-income communities; have gerrymandered out low- and moderate-income communities in the case of Michigan National Bank of Oakland; have made only minimal efforts at communicating credit information; and ""because race seems to be playing such a major role in their lending patterns.""Michigan National Corp., asked for comment, said that all of its subsidiary banks have complied, and will continue to comply, with the CRA and all relevant regulations. A spokesman said there is no substance to the protest, which he said is based upon incomplete data and which contains conclusions not based upon fact. He declined to comment on specific charges of the committee.Bobby McQuade, administrative aide at the committee, said that during 1976-1978 Michigan National's nine subsidiaries and branches in the greater Detroit area originated only 29 conventional mortgage loans in all the low-and moderate-income neighborhoods of the area. The 29, based on the committee's analysis of HMDA statements filed by the subsidiaries, do not include one subsidiary's 1976 HMDA data which Mr. McQuade said was unavailable.Mr. McQuade said, ""Our analysis shows that as soon as census tracts reached only 1% or 2% black population, the number of loans made by the nine subsidiaries of Michigan National dropped in half in the tricountry region in 1976-78."""
"300 LARGEST U.S. COMMERCIAL BANKS;
Preparing for the Federal Compliance Examination",The American Banker,"February 28, 1979, Wednesday","First, I would divide myself mentally into two individuals. One would be my natural self and the other would be a part of me that was prepared just to listen to what the first one had to say. The first person - the natural ""me"" - would probably burst out in exasperation. Why does the bank have to spend so much time and effort - so many precious resources - trying to understand and comply with so many long, complicated rules that seem to have been written by people who never talked to a customer or evaluated a credit risk or made a loan? Why all this expensive time-consuming paperwork that the customer doesn't pay any attention to anyhow? Why this assumption that bankers like me are trying to turn away good customers? Why can't we follow our instincts and our experience in deciding whether to lend to somebody, or to make loans in some particular part of town?The other part would listen until the first one, the ""natural banker"" had finished ventilating, and then would probably say something like this. Well, after all, it's the law, and our job is to obey the law. The laws are passed by Congress, and I may not agree with them, but Congress was elected by ordinary people. Maybe our customers are sending us a message. Perhaps there are some things we could do differently that would make them like us better and use our services more. For instance customers might like to know, in simple english, the terms of their loans. Maybe there are some worthwhile markets out there that we have been neglecting, singles for example, or small businesses that have growth potential, or particular minority groups. Maybe we could improve our image as a positive force in the community.After this dialogue, I think I would begin drawing up my action plan by defining a specific goal. I might describe that goal as being to bring our bank into compliance with the regulations in the most cost-effective way possible and to get the most mileage possible for the bank out of complying. I would bear in mind two essential prerequisites to success. The first is that top management must understand and support the program. We cannot succeed unless the rest of the bank sees that the CEO and the board of directors are behind us one hundred per cent. The second is that the program must be ongoing. It will be useless to redesign forms, retrain personnel and market our new image if the program dissolves in a year or so as key people are promoted or leave the bank.The other part would listen until the first one, the ""natural banker"" had finished ventilating, and then would probably say something like this.

I would bear in mind two essential prerequisites to success. The first is that top management must understand and support the program. We cannot succeed unless the rest of the bank sees that the CEO and the board of directors are behind us one hundred per cent. The second is that the program must be ongoing. It will be useless to redesign forms, retrain personnel and market our new image if the program dissolves in a year or so as key people are promoted or leave the bank.Next, I would utilize the resources available to help me define problems and arrive at solutions. First I would review the latest consumer affairs examination report on my bank. Then I would call my Reserve Bank (assuming that we are a member of the System) and arrange for an advisory visit at the learliest possible date (if a nonmember, I would find out what seminars the Reserve Bank or my trade association is offering on compliance and arrange to attend). The advisory visit will give me a thorough, dispassionate but friendly evaluation by a skilled outsider. I will expect to get from it a pretty clear picture of our bank's areas of strength and weakness.Meanwhile, whether we are a member of the System or not, I would ask the Reserve Bank to send me copies of the relevant regulations and of the System's new compliance handbook. The handbook includes explanations of the laws and regulations, with special emphasis on what the courts have held about the interpretation of the civil rights statues, guidelines on enforcement of Regulations B and Z, examiners instructions and checklists. If our bank is not a State member, I would also ask our primary supervisor for copies of their examination materials, and in any event I would go to my trade association for any helpful materials they could give me.The next step would be to pull together all the materials in the bank that we would have to review. We would want copies of all the forms we give to customers or ask customers to fill out for us (or with us), and of all the internal forms used to evaluate credits. We would want any handbooks or manuals the bank uses on credit standards and, if the bank has none, of any written criteria in use. In either event, I would want to interview our loan officers as well as members of loan committees and make notes of the criteria they actually use in deciding whether to extend credit. Are the criteria they are using consistent from one to another? We would want marketing plans going back several years as well as files of advertising the bank has done over the same period.I would get all written training materials we used and make notes on any training we give our people, especially the employees who come into contact with the public and those who evaluate loan applications behind the scenes. I would want a list of these employees' names and positions and a table of organization showing how they fit into the bank's hierarchy, who supervises them and how they relate with one another. If we have automated programs, a credit card, an EFT card, an automated overdraft program, I would want to talk with the people who designed and operate the oprogams and examine the criteria used for granting or terminating accounts as well as procedures for handling billing errors.I would begin to look outside the bank too, in a preliminary way at this stage. How do we define our community? What are the agencies of local government that would be concerned with the way in which our bank serves its community, like a local office of consumer affairs or community development? Who are the key people to contact in those agencies? What citizen groups are active in the community? Who are their key people? What are their attitudes toward the bank? How do they perceive us? And who are the business people we deal with? Who are the real estate brokers who send us business? What appraisers do we use? Are their appraisal standards nondiscriminatory? Are they aware of prohibited appraisal practices? What instructions or suggestions have they given us, or have we given them, for selecting potential customers or real estate on which we would be willing to lend?Now that I had a pretty complete picture of the way our bank is operating and how it relates to our community, I would be ready to sit down with our attorneys and design our program. Because I am a team player, and because a compliance program will only work if it develops naturally, in an integrated way, out of the bank's policies and operations, I would also involve the responsible line officers in the bank. If we were working on an affirmative lending program, for example, we would set up a task force including people who set loan policies, marketing people and personnel people responsible for training.In a very real sense, this program will be a seamless web. Each part of it will relate to other parts; a change in one can require a whole series of changes in apparently unrelated parts. For example, if we decide to begin to emphasize serving a part of the community we have not served before, we may have to revise our lending criteria, change our forms, revise our training procedures, design new marketing techniques.We have to start somewhere, though, and perhaps the best place to begin is with our lending standards. We need to understand what they are, and if not documented we need to write them down and then test them. Are they effective in helping us select the loans we want to make? Do they comply with the law? Do they have the effect (even if unintended) of systematically screening out members of a legally protected class such as women or minorities? If the criteria in use have that sort of effect, can we justify using them by showing that they do in fact select good credits and screen out those that are likely to go bad? Is there any better, less ""discriminatory"" way of selecting the credits we want? In making this analysis, we will want to remember that the Equal Credit Opportunity Act applies to business as well as residential mortgage lending.Once we have a good, clear, effective, and defensible set of written lending standards, we probably want next to review all our forms. The advisory visit from the Reserve Bank should have given us a good start. But we will want to go over them ourselves very thoroughly and be sure we understand them and that they further our bank's policy goals and objectives. Are we giving customers all the information they are entitled to? Is our Truth in Lending disclosure accurate and understandable (we may have to pay back substantial ""overcharges"" if we make a mistake)? Have we asked the questions we must ask in connection with residential mortgage loans, like age, sex, and race of applicant, have we coded the address of the subject property by census tract, and have we refrained from asking the questions we are not allowed to ask, like whether the borrower is receiving alimony or child support? Are we giving customers who don't get their loans an adequate statement of the reasons for denial? Are we reporting credit histories of both spouses?Next, we will want to look at training. Regular clases or seminars and good written training materials will be a key item when we face our examiners. And here it will be particularly important to build in continuity. Personnel changes, and so do the regulations. New rules will be coming out soon, for example, on EFT and on consumers' rights to financial privacy. We will want to set up a schedule for regular refresher courses and a training program so that all new employees who deal with consumer credit (or for that matter, credit to small business) will go through.Also, our auditing staff can lend support to the compliance effort by building tests into the routine audit. Are disclosures given in a timely manner? Are disclosures completed properly? Do dealers or other agents acting on our behalf fulfill all the requirements and avoid prohibitions?Our marketing program will build naturally on everything we have done up to this point. We want to make sure that we convey the message that we serve our entire community (including low and moderate income neighborhoods), that we are interested in women and minority customers, that we are consumer-oriented.With our program developed, my next job will be to prepare a presentation for the CEO and for the board of directors. It will have to be short and punchy, easy to understand, but backed up with thoroughly thought-out proposals and data on costs and benefits. I will want to explain, especially, the costs to the bank of being found in non-compliance. We will aim for a positive discussion by the board, recorded in the minutes, or their commitment to compliance and to serving our community.The details of the program will differ from bank to bank, depending on its size, its market, and the way it has been oriented to consumer affairs. And a great deal will depend on the good sense and hard work of the team that develops the bank's specific proposals. But with the commitment of the bank's board of directors, and the backing of the CEO, we will expect to get through our Federal compliance examination with flying colors.Picture, JANET O. HART"
"Banks and Thrifts Argue Over Taxes, With No Fast Answer to Who Pays Most",The American Banker,"September 11, 1979, Tuesday","The commercial bankers frequently bemoan the fact that they have a difficult time competing with the thrifts, because, they hold, the thrifts do not have to pay the taxes that banks are subject to.Thrift executives, however, have published studies that show exactly the opposite: that thrifts pay a good bit more in Federal taxes than banks do.There is no simple answer as to the question of who gets the better arrangement in taxation.
MutualityOf course what makes the question more difficult to resolve is the fact that most thrifts are mutual organizations. It is very difficult to compare the tax situation of a bank that is owned by stockholders and is taxed on income, with that of a savings bank or savings and loan whose owners are the depositors and whose dividend payments are interest, tax deductible to the institution, paid on savings deposits.Even so, by comparing taxes on assets and on gross earnings, each industry has been able to prove that the other pays less than it does. How is this possible? The issue appears to boil down to this:
AveragesThe savings and loans are correct when they report that on average they pay more taxes on assets or on gross revenue than commercial banks do. For in the commercial bank averages are included the institutions that have been heavily involved in leasing operations and in foreign lending, both of which operations generate considerable sums of tax credits.On top of this, aggressive bankers have taken advantage of the opportunity to develop tax deductible losses on their depreciated bonds, which further cut tax liabilities.It is recognized that this feature of the tax law was developed to allow the banks to be more useful in fighting recession by encouraging them to make aggressive investments, and the value of these ""tax swamps"" to the nation can be appreciated. But this does further cut their tax liability.Finally some banks have moved heavily into tax-exempt bonds, which offer lower yield than would be available from corporates, agencies or Federal government obligations. But they do have the advantage of no Federal income tax liability.Thus some banks have worked their tax liability down to very little or even to nothing.When these institutions' tax liabilities are averaged into the overall bank tax payment position, it cuts the average tax liability and does make the average tax paid by the thrifts higher than the average banks pay, as the thrift industry avers.
Individual BanksBut to the individual community bank in the U.S., which does not have a leasing operation or foreign tax credits, the statement that savings institutions pay more taxes than commercial banks do, is a laugh.For community bankers know that in their own communities they are paying far more taxes than the thrifts located there do under present IRS formulas.One thing that should be understood is that both groups are more equal when it comes to paying taxes than in the past. For there was a time when savings institutions paid no taxes as long as they undertook new investments in buildings and expanded other expenses whenever their earnings rates rose close to a cutoff level.The fact that many savings institutions now buy tax-exempt bonds too shows that they are also heavy taxpayers in our society. Thus the days are gone when banks could justly complain that they were taxpayers while the thrifts were not.But as to who pays the most taxes today, this remains a question that is unanswerable unless you define what approach you want to take in measuring tax liability.Thus both banks and thrifts are likely to continue to complain that they pay more taxes than their competitors do, and no end to the confusion that these counter claims cause is in sight."

Regulators Close 2 Chi. Banks,The American Banker,"July 17, 1979, Tuesday","The larger of the latest two -- the $9.1 million-deposit Gateway National Bank --m. by John G. Heimann, Comptroller of the Currency.William C. Harris, the Illinois Commissioner of Banks and Trust Companies, had closed the other -- the $7.4 million-deposit Guaranty Bank & Trust Co. -- half an hour earlier.Collapse of the two banks was attributed by regulators mainly to inadequate management and erosion of capital bases as a result of chronic loan and operational problems.The deposit accounts and cash of the failed banks were assumed in a $900,000 purchase agreement by a third minority-held institution, the $59.8 million-deposit Independence Bank of Chicago, the nation's largest black-owned bank. Independence is also one of the strongest and best-managed minority banks in the country, according to Mr. Harris.All three banks were located close to one other in black communities on Chicago's South side.The failed banks reopened Monday as temporary branches of Independence under a special arrangement made by the Illinois Banking Department to accommodate customers during ""this transition period,"" Mr. Harris said.The Commissioner said the banks were closed on the same day because of ""concern about a negative ripple effect in the community of one closed minority bank followed by another. We studiously worked against that eventuality.""Irving H. Sprague, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which was appointed receiver, said the transaction was made possible by the close coordination between the State of Illinois, the Comptroller's Office, the Federal Reserve System, Chicago-area banks and the FDIC.In an unusual agreement made in advance, the regulators also limited bidding to other minority-owned banks in what Mr. Harris called a ""classic example of government practicing affirmative action.""Other bidders were the $62.2 million-deposit Seaway National Bank and $27.6 million-deposit Highland Community Bank, both of Chicago.Independence Bank is paying a premium of $300,000 for Guaranty's 5,200 deposit accounts and $600,000 for Gateway's 7,300 deposit accounts. In addition, Independence must increase its capital accounts by $2 million, according to an FDIC statement. A total of $600,000 is due by Dec. 31 and the rest immediately.To effect the transaction, Independence received a $1.4 million loan from its principal correspondent, the $20.8 billion-deposit Continental Illinois National Bank & Trust Co. of Chicago.Alvin J. Boutte, president of Independence, told reporters Monday that the Continental Illinois loan -- in the form of a debenture -- was granted to Indecorp, Inc., a bank holding company newly formed as parent of Independence. Indecorp's formation was approved over the weekend by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago as part of the takeover arrangement.Mr. Boutte explained that Independence Bank will issue a stock offering later this year to raise the additional $600,000 due by Dec. 31. A special stockholders' meeting will be held within two to three months to approve the stock issuance, Independence officials said.The FDIC has picked up approximately $23 million in loans from both banks but an official said the agency at present has no idea of how much it will recover. Independence has 60 days in which to decide whether it wants any of the asset portfolio of the closed banks.Mr. Harris, in a press conference Saturday, said the state-chartered Guaranty Bank had not been profitable for nearly two years. ""It's just a history of bad lending practice and inadequate management.""Officers of the bank were unwilling to add capital, Mr. Harris said of the bank, which was established in 1946 and was purchased in 1973 by the World Community of Islam in the West, also known as the Black Muslims.The Comptroller's report on Gateway National said that managerial and operational problems, which became apparent after less than two years of operation, were never satisfactorily resolved despite several changes in ownership.The national bank, chartered in 1957, had ""only seven profitable years in its 22-year history, despite infusions of additional equity capital in 1973 and 1976. By Dec. 31, 1978, capital funds had been reduced to $315,000; operational losses reached $199,000 for the first half of 1979, and gross capital funds were reduced to $70,000 by June 30, 1979,"" the Comptroller's report said.Gateway's principal shareholder was Alderman Joseph G. Bertrand, former city treasurer of Chicago.The two banks were the fourth and fifth declared insolvent in the United States in 1979 and the seventh and eighth minority-held banks to close since 1973.The failures decrease the number of black-owned banks in the U.S. from 52 to 50 and the number in Chicago from seven to five. Four of the Chicago banks are on the South Side and the fifth is on the West Side, areas in which most of chicago's back population lives.Four banks have failed in Illinois since early 1978.Before the collapse of the two Chicago banks, there were 98 classified as institutions with majority ownership by blacks, Hispanics, women, Asian-Americans or American Indians.While the problems of minority-held banks are numerous -- among them, attracting experienced second-line management, and finding adequate credit opportunities and stable deposit sources --could find not just one but three acceptable minority banks willing to take over the collapsed banks is evidence that there are also solid, well managed black-owned institutions.""Among minority banks in this country, Independence is considered one of the healthiest in part because it draws from one of the more stable black residential sections of the city, known as the Chatham area. Its headquarters is at 79th St. and Cottage Grove Ave.Also, the bank's directors have been known to maintain active, day-to-day involvement. They include leading black businessmen, including the chairman, George E. Johnson, who is president of Johnson Products Co., a Chicago manufacturer of hair products and one of the four largest black-owned businesses in the country.A high proportion of Independence officers gained training and experience at large white-owned Loop banks, industry sources noted.Mr. Boutte told newsmen at the Monday briefing, held on Gateway premises, that the failed Gateway Bank will remain open as limited-service facility of Independence while Guaranty will be closed within 60 days.By midday Monday, the first day of business under the Independence banner, the institution recorded a deposit runoff of $37,000. Mr. Boutte described this as a highly encouraging figure."
Okla. Lawmakers Will Get Two Bills To Allow Multibank HCs in the State,The American Banker,"January 4, 1979, Thursday","Rep. Bernard J. McIntyre, D., Tulsa, vice chairman of the House Banks and Banking Committee, will introduce one. The other is to be presented by Sen. Lee Cate, D., Norman, and is expected to have backing of a new state organizations, Oklahomans for Better Banking, formed this year with membership consisting of about 130 banks, large and small.The two bills will have some similar aspects. Each will permit a holding company to have more than one bank but will restrict its deposit total to not more than 15% of the total held by all banks in Oklahoma.Mr. McIntyre's bill will permit one extended facility such as a drive-in operation, in a city with less than 25,000 population and two extended facilities in a city of more than 25,000.The Senate bill, a revision of one which died in the Senate Banks and Banking Committee during the 1978 session, would enable holding companies to go outside the city limits and establish extended facilities in any incorporated city within the county in which the holding company is based provided the community has no bank, the application shows need and is approved by the State Bank Commissioner's office.Under present Oklahoma banking laws, a bank is permitted but one extended facility, which must be within 1,000 feet of its headquarters.Mr. McIntyre, an employee in the personal banking department of the $691.4 million-deposit American State Bank, also Tulsa, Oklahoma's first minority-owned bank, said he sees no conflict in the fact he is involved in banking and plans to introduce his measure in the House early in the 1979 session.""I think my experience will be beneficial,"" Mr. McIntyre said. ""I don't see any more conflict than for a lawyer serving on the judiciary committee, or a farmer being on a committee dealing with agricultural matters.""I propose to modernize Oklahoma's bank structure by presenting this legislation, which will protect the small unit banks and give other banks the opportunity to grow and to experience limited expansion.""He declared that Oklahoma ultimately must alter its banking code.""The day has to come,"" he said. ""Whether the Comptroller of the Currency acts or not, we must do this as a state ourselves. I would rather the Comptroller not become involved, but he has his job to do, too.""Comptroller John G. Heimann approved in September a full-service branch for the $39.5 million-deposit First National Bank & Trust Co. of Okmulgee. Three days after it opened, Judge Frederick A. Daugherty of the United States District Court in Oklahoma City issued a temporary injunction, closing the branch, pending a full hearing. The hearing probably will be held early this year.The two bills point up again the wide rift running through the state's banking community.The Oklahoma Bankers Association, whose membership includes practically all of the state's 476 active banks, has taken a neutral stance.But Oklahomas for Better Banking has voiced strong support for a bill permitting multibank holding companies in Oklahoma. And the Independent Bankers association of Oklahoma, a group consisting of small and large banks, is opposed to any measure permitting branching or multibank holding companies.The IOBA's newly elected president, Jack W. Dickey, chairman and president of the $10.i million-deposit First National Bank of Thomas, said he will lead the fight to defeat both proposals.""Establishment of multibank holding companies will concentrate wealth in the hands of a few powerful people living in Tulsa and Oklahoma City who will dictate bank policy for local communities,"" Mr. Dickey maintained.""We also are opposed to branch banking, because it will increase the cost of banking, which will be passed on to the customer."""
Western Union View on Competitive Issues in Fed Plan for Pricing Services,The American Banker,"May 14, 1979, Monday","Services which the Federal Reserve Board now supplies without explicit pricing to automated clearing houses around the country include data acquisition and delivery (both electronic and physical), data processing and bulk data/information transmission. Paramount in the provision of these services are data security and concern for timeliness of delivery.If, in alternative offerings to those to the Federal Reserve Board, private-sector supplies were to provide ACHs with these services, how successful would these suppliers be, given the proposed pricing schedule announced by the Fed?Before I answer this question, I would like to add that the Fed also provides the settlement mechanism for ACHs. Whether this function can be provided by the private sector is a moot question at present, and I will not address this particular point today.However, given the pricing of ACH services as proposed by the Fed, I believe there are considerations to potential private sector suppliers which depend upon several factors, the most important being:The degree to which demands on the supplier's teleprocessing facilities, resources and overall capabilities are incremental, thereby allowing less than full cost pricing.Transaction volume and its growth pattern.As we start to assess these, let me make the point that I am not endeavoring to represent the reactions of potential private-sector suppliers as a whole. Nevertheless, when asked if we would speak on the subject, Western Union felt that it might indeed provide useful perspective to examine the reaction of a company which over the years has worked closely with many elements of the financial community -- from its initial development of Bank Wire I in the early 1950s to a successful demonstration of the viability of satellite transmission techniques for point-of-sale transaction in the 1970s. (Incidentally, the sales receipt for that first satellite POS transaction is on display at the Smithsonian Institute in Washington, D.C.)Western Union also provides data processing and information services to more than 600 financial institutions across the United States through two of its subsidiaries: National Sharedata Corp. and Telstat Systems, Inc. Another subsidiary, Western Union Data Services Corp., provides data terminals for the Bank Wire II System.Western Union's analysis concerning ACH services provided by the private sector shows that in order to compete with proposed Fed pricing, a private-sector supplier must have major resources in terms of facilities, manpower and experience. There must be an allowance for an incremental cost/pricing approach, and monthly ACH transaction volume must be in the order of magnitude of 50 million.In discussing the impact of the Fed's proposed pricing upon the private sector's view of the market potential for ACH services, let me add a casual observation. Up to now the private sector has had the option of expending significant capital to develop a service which would compete with a free service provided by the Federal Reserve. Obviously, that is not an attractive opportunity.Consequently, there was no apparent initiative on the part of the private sector to develop such a competing service. Opportunities existed, however, for suppliers of terminals, communications facilities and data processing equipment. These opportunities will continue regardless of the final approach selected.When viewing the problem faced by a supplier from the private sector who is seeking to provide a total service, one issue stands out: the development of a system to provide nationwide service to the financial institutions will require, in absolute terms, a high capital investment with a resultant set of high fixed costs. This translates into a high unit cost-per-item-handled during the years in which volumes do not exceed greak-even theresholds. An example of this, with which you are familiar, can be found in Bank Wire II. It has been reported in the banking press that the new system requires a per-message-cost of nearly 60 cents --nearly three times the per-message-cost of Bank Wire I. Obviously, as volume developes, the per-message cost should decline dramatically, but until then the high fixed costs must be recovered by a high message price.From the supplier's viewpoint, the pricing schedule and the apparent volume must be such as to provide a fair recovery rate of the initial capital investment and ongoing operating costs within an acceptable risk factor and time frame.The level of investment, the ongoing costs and the resultant risks can be reduced by private suppliers who are able to design a meaningful ACH service within the structure of other existing services and facilities. The potential suppliers who are thus capable of developing this incremental approach could minimize the need for additional capital expenditures and include the costs and risks within the structure of a broader service offering. This would make it much easier for them to add incremental ACH capacity as volume grows.It seems to us that in attempting to arrive at meaningful pricing levels and to project their effect upon private sector suppliers, the financial community is faced with conflicting objectives. From one viewpoint, the pricing levels must be high enough to encourage the private sector to risk investment capital. From another viewpoint, the pricing levels must be low enough to encourage migration to the private ACH method of operation.Obviously, this trade-off can only be evaluated by the financial community.At Western Union our economic models predict that a private supplier having existing services and facilities in place could effectively compete with the Federal Reserve Board's pricing schedules at traffic levels assumed for the mid-1980s. However, at the proposed pricing levels, we see no way of effective competition until then, the mid-'80s. This analysis is based upon an incremental approach which superimposes an ACH service upon existing services and facilities; thereby reducing costs and risks, as far as that specific ACH operation would be concerned. For those prospective suppliers not having such a service and facility base, the problem will undoubtedly be more difficult.The current information processing service is being subsidized by the Federal Reserve Board directly and the users of the service indirectly. The Federal Reserve Board's proposed pricing schedule does not appear to remove the subsidy or even materially lessen it during the early years. Obviously someone is paying the true cost of the service, and I suspect the cost to be a hidden one of the users. I cannot speak for the public interest, private sector, users or the Federal Reserve Board as to the desirability of this subsidy. However, speaking for one element of the private sector, it is always difficult to compete with a subsidized operation.To accommodate and facilitate the future high volumes which have been projected, we believe that a system of ACH processing which performs the functions of data acquisition, processing and distribution within an ACH area will have to be combined with a nationwide communications system providing interchange among ACHs on a continentwide scale. Data entry, processing and distribution capability within an ACH area is already well developed, and progress concerning these tasks will be a straightforward evolution of needs and technology. However, the cost-effective interconnection of regional ACHs and major financial institutions, within a nationwide communication context, is the new element which must be added.Because of our available physical facilities and communications expertise, Western Union feels uniquely positioned to make a significant contribution to the success of the ACH service concept, particularly in this nationwide interconnection. Decisions as to the degree of participation by various elements of the public and private sectors, of course, are up to the Federal Reserve board and the financial community.Western Union stands ready to cooperate in whatever scenario develops."
Minn. Sues to Halt Deposit Box Sales,The American Banker,"October 10, 1979, Wednesday","Alleging the Brainerd bank is carrying on illegal operations at the limited service facility, the commissioner seeks an injunction against Brainerd National from offering the safety deposit box services.Under Minnesota's detached facility law, banks are limited to opening deposit accounts, receiving deposits, cashing checks, issuing drafts, money orders and traveler checks, accepting loan applications and receiving payments payable at the bank.Minnesota banks are permitted two detached facilities, to be located anywhere within 5,000 feet from a bank's principal office or up to 25 miles from a main office if in a nonbank community.In a press release, Mr. Pint said state law clearly defines and limits the services a detached banking facility may offer -- ""sales of safety deposit boxes are not among them.""The commissioner said he filed suit to ""protect the public interest"" and assure ""competitive equality"" between Federal and state-chartered banks."

Moody's Giving Chrysler Ratings 'Close Scrutiny',The American Banker,"July 31, 1979, Tuesday","Chrysler's senior debt and preferred stock are Ba-rated by Moody's.""Chrysler has suffered from relatively weak earnings for a number of years, sustaining losses in 1974, 1975, 1978 and the first quarter of 1979, and its share of the U.S. car market has been declining,"" Moody's noted.""The combination of reduced market share and a drop in industry sales as the U.S. economy heads into a recession makes the possibility of further large losses very likely,"" it added.""Earnings problems have drastically reduced Chrysler's access to normal external sources of funds,"" the rating service said.

Multioffice Banking Voted by Illinois Unit,The American Banker,"April 27, 1979, Friday","The bill, drafted by the 230-member Association for Modern Banking in Illinois, provides for multibank holding companies but would limit each to operation within one of five geographic regions.The proposal faces an uphill fight in the full House as a result of strong opposition from community bankers to any structure change.

Loan Customers Are Found as Irate As Banks over Consumer Paperwork,The American Banker,"October 6, 1979, Saturday","In a survey conducted by a Tennessee bank, Truth-in-Lending Act and Equal Credit Opportunity Act requirements draw more criticism from bank consumers than other Federal regulations. The consumers complained of the immense paperwork required of them and the delay involved in closing a loan under those two laws.Last February, the ABA sent a letter to all its more than 13,000 members soliciting specific examples of ""senseless and costly overregulation and paperwork."" The letter encouraged bankers to focus on their customers' point of view. The ABA said it hoped to collect ""facts which show that well-intentioned Congressional efforts to help consumers have actually harmed them.Nearly all the 210 respondents cited instances in which bank customers tossed out their T-in-L disclosure forms before leaving the bank. Several bankers recounted their experiences with irate customers who were disturbed with the amount paperwork involved in a loan application.A consensus appeared among the respondents that the T-in-L rule -- Regulation Z --was of little use, especially the three-day cooling-off period required on loans where the applicant's residence is given as security.""Of all the mortgage loans we have made since Regulation Z was instituted, we have not had a single borrower excercise right of rescission,"" said one Tennessee banker.As an illustration of the inconvenience arising from this right, a Kansas bank executive recounted an incident in which a customer used the equity on his home as collateral for a second mortgage loan. The customer intended to invest in a small business with the loan. However, due to the mandatory three-day right of recission, he forfeited this opportunity to a cash purchaser within the three-day ""cooling off"" period.A Montana bank president illustrated the extent of the paperwork problem in figures from one loan application from a married couple. Of the 81 separate pieces of paper prepared by the bank, 26 were needed for the lending process. Half the time expended by the customer in closing the loan was devoted to Federal consumer protection regulation forms.Increased costs resulting from Federal red tape which are passed on to customers were raised by several bankers. According to the Montana figures, the additional cost to the consumer in closing a loan was $150 above what it would have been without the Federal paperwork.Community bankers complained that consumer protection regulations have widened the gap between banks and their customers. They said that, because of T-in-L, they can no longer service their loan customers for a reasonable price.A North Dakota banker attributed his cost increase to the hiring of legal counsel to deal with regulations. Although most customers are known personally by their community bankers, they now must wait three days before they receive the loan when they use their residences as security, said a Pennsylvania banker.The severity and nature of the problems bankers encountered varied with the size and locations of their institutions, the letters showed.The general tone of the bankers' replies reflected exasperation and anger.""Let me suggest that we cease negotiations and stand up and fight,"" said one Mississippi banker.""Our bank was even giving some consideration to dropping out of state and national associations,"" a Wisconsin bank executive wrote, ""because of their apparent lack of concern for our number one problem."""
Europeans Not Leaping To US Lure,The American Banker,"October 10, 1979, Wednesday","Technically, the new regulations seem to leave a loophole by imposing an additional reserve base against the worldwide dollar liabilities of banks in the United States without a similar reserve on the dollar liabilities of banks abroad which are outside the control of the Federal Reserve. It follows that European and other foreign banks could in theory compete more effectively than banks in the United States for the dollar deposits of large American corporations and then use the funds to compete at an advantage also on the lending side of the American market.However banks here do not foresee this happening in reality for two reasons. The first is that nearly all of the world's biggest banks, being the ones which really matter, are included among the approximately 275 foreign banks represented in the United States through branches, subsidiaries or other offices. In the case of many, they could expand their international dollar liabilities in the United States without penalty only up to the base limit of $100 million stipulated by the Federal Reserve Board or alternatively, the average of such liabilities during the two weeks to Sept. 26, whichever is higher. The position of individual foreign banks in respect to that limit is not yet quite clear because it depends how their American operations are classified in relation to their foreign operations. Far more important, however, is the ""political"" inhibition which bankers here say they would feel about flagrantly poaching on the home ground of American banks.""We are highly leanable on and we would be mad to put our important investment in the American market at risk by blatantly chasing after for the business of American banks from our foreign offices,"" said a spokesman of one major British clearing bank Tuesday.That does not mean that European bankers see no threat at all to U.S. banks from the discrimination of the new reserve requirements. The most important threat in their view is from the commercial paper market which circumvents the banking system. But beyond that, there is a belief here that the banking community will eventually find some way or combination of ways around the latest controls, which is what has happened on every previous occasion during the past 20 years. But the way in which the financial community may eventually discover how to frustrate the latest impediments is not yet clear here because even official sources and many of the largest U.S. banks still have only a partial interpretation of the new regulation. Moreover, while foreign banks with American operations may feel inhibited about a provacative encroachment on the homeground of American banks in the short-term, they would feel less inhibited about using competitive advantages available to them gradually over the longer run. That will depend partly on how long the present reserve requirements remain enforced and partly also on the extent of business loan demand in the United States. For the moment, however, it seems as though a large part of the offshore American dollar market may be on its way back home.Meanwhile on the exchanges, the dollar made a further though modest recovery against other major currencies with late Tuesday quotations of $2.1425 against sterling and DM 1.8025, SW FR 1.6275, and Y 226.50. But the gold price recovered $10 of Monday's $13 decline, ending Tuesday at $386 an ounce."

"Financial Leaders Say Incentives, Less Red Tape Needed on Energy",The American Banker,"July 17, 1979, Tuesday","This was the financial community's first reaction to the President's plan to establish funding mechanisms for promotion of synthetic fuel production and widespread use of solar energy.Industry sources added that financial institutions already have adequate funds for energy lending, but the absence of government and private industry incentives has not made it attractive.In his speech Sunday night, President Carter proposed two main programs for financing energy needs. He recommended establishing an Energy Security Corporation, a government-sponsored independent corporation, to pormote production of oil energy substitutes using a variety of techniques, including direct loans, loan guarantees and federal purchase agreements.The President also proposed creation of a solar bank to encourage the use of solar energy through subsidized loans to homeowners.Financial industry officials interviewed Monday said the success of the President's program would depend largely on the Administration's ability to gain the support of community leaders, environmentalists, real estate appraisers and other special interest groups.In addition, they said, much will depend on the success of a proposed Energy Mobilization Board. The EMB is intended to reduce delays in the development of production facilities by mandating schedules for the completion of projects, often by waiving procedural requirements of state and local governments.The feeling was that many groups have been working at cross purposes in the past, and this as much as anything has hindered programs to increase the nation's energy independence.Mr. Carter's proposed Energy Security Corporation would direct the investment of approximately $88 billion to produce 2.5 million barrels per day of nonimported energy. The Administration said the corporation would be funded with receipts from the proposed windfall profits tax on oil companies. To encourage projects to find alternatives to oil, the corporation's financing devices would include price guarantees, federal purchase agreements, direct loans, loan guarantees, and a limited number of government-owned plants.Partial support for the Energy Security Corporation would come from bond sales of up to $5 billion. President Carter said in his speech Sunday night he wanted the bonds ""to be in small denominations so that average Americans can invest directly in America's energy security.""The plan calls for direct funding for operating expenses, and budget authority of $83 billion for direct obligations and debt guarantees.The Administration did not provide an outline of the amounts the Energy Security Corp. would use in each category of financing devices.The Solar Bank suggested by the President would pay direct subsidies to banks and other lenders for making below-market rate mortgage and home improvement loans that involve solar energy systems.The interest subsidy would apply only to that portion of a loan which directly finances the solar investment, according to the White House. The rate of the interest subsidy would be determined by the three-member board of the Solar Bank, composed of the Secretaries of the Departments of Energy, Treasury and Housing and Urban Development.Annual funding for the Solar Bank of $150 million would come from a trust fund of receipts from the oil company income taxes and the windfall profits tax.The maximum loan size which would qualify for a subsidy would be $10,000 for a single-family dwelling, $5,000 for each unit of a multi-family residence up to $500,000, and $200,000 for a commercial building.The Administration estimated that the Solar Bank could assist in the funding of more than 150,000 solar energy installations per year at the suggested level of funding."
Olin Seeks 'Level' Oregon Field,The American Banker,"February 7, 1979, Wednesday","The Oregon Bankers Association, contending government regulations tend to favor thrifts and other non-bank financial institutions, has adopted -- and has widely used and repeated -- the theme that all the institutions should be ""playing on a level field.""Earlier this month, Superintendent of Banking John B. Olin ruled, over the opposition of the Oregon BA, that state-chartered credit unions be allowed to issue share drafts.He quickly followed it with another decision, also opposed by the Oregon BA, permitting Citicorp Person-to-Person Financial Centers to offer ""Convenience Accounts"" (line of credit against which drafts may be written to effect loans.)The normally amicable relationship between Mr. Olin and the Oregon BA was shattered. Banking representatives angrily denounced Mr. Olin's decisions, and did not fail to stress what they considered his tilting of ""the level playing field.""Taken aback, but undaunted, Mr. Olin has tacitly acknowledged the bankers' complaints. There now sits prominently on his office desk a carpenter's level -- tilted heavily to one side.He will not say to which side."
Pay Me Now or Pay Me Later,The American Banker,"May 10, 1979, Thursday","The decision, based upon the agency's opinion that the volume of mortgages provided to the territory the bank serves was too low, is one more incursion of regulators into the operations of the banking industry. Far more significant, it indicates that regulators are now able to influence and review positive actions of a bank or thrift instead of just making sure that it is not doing things that could have a negative impact on the community.This is a major change.Until recently, regulation has had it as its main goal to insure that banks and thrifts were safe and providing adequate protection to depositors. Beyond this, the decisions of banks and thrifts as to how to act were largely the province of the executives and boards of the institutions themselves.Regulators objected to a considerable extent that this was not an adequate control mechanism. For if the examiners felt that an institution was not following safe practices or was operating with too little capital, it took a long time for the regulators to effect any change. Their powers were limited.Thus bankers could hear the complaints about their liquidity policies and about inadequate capital adequacy, and they could really take their time in implementing the changes requested. For the teeth of the regulators were either too weak or too strong. They could either close the bank or deny it Federal insurance on the one hand, or let the bank continue to operate as before with continued warnings.The regulators recognized that their main power was that when the banks came to them for approval of an action that needed regulatory sanction, such as a merger, acquisition, change in capitalization or the like, only then could the regulators enforce their prior requests. Until then, they stood like the man waving his fists screaming ""wait until I get you"" as the harasser runs away. But bankers could ignore pleas to raise more capital or to augment loan loss reserves for a certain amount of time, under the theory that they did not need anything from the regulators and thus could ignore them.Yet in virtually all cases, something would come along that would need regulatory approval. And then the banks had to satisfy the demands the examiners had been making all along.It was like the ads of the car repair men that would say ""pay me now or pay me later."" Either you pay me to maintain the car or you'll pay me for major car repairs later.Bankers may feel that they still have control over where they lend and to whom they lend. But if they need regulatory approval of any major change, this control shifts to the regulator, as Greater New York learned.And the institutions that feel that they can ignore the new mandates of the CRA had better ask themselves whether they, too, will be needing any approvals from their regulators in the near future before they continue to make decisions based solely on bank policy and not moderated by policies established by the regulators, the CRA, or the other governmental forces that are impinging on banking.This is what worries bankers. For today it may be that meeting these standards will be necessary only for major approvals like a branch or a merger. But more and more regulatory approval is being required for small decisions like opening an ATM or offering a new mortgage form. And each such incursion makes regulatory control over bank lending and investing that much stronger."
Boston HC Seeks Chatham Trust Co.,The American Banker,"January 9, 1979, Tuesday","The Chatham bank would become a branch of the holding company's $29.6 million-deposit Barnstable County National Bank of Hyannis, also Cape Cod. The Barnstable County bank does not have a Chatham office.""Cape Cod has become the Florida of the Northeast,"" said John Rees, Merchants' chief financial officer. ""Our Cape Cod operation is doing well, and we want to expand. The Cape has become a retirement community, and it's one of the fastest-growing areas in the country.""The acquisition proposal needs the approval of the Comptroller of the Currency and the State Commissioner of Banks. Shareholders of Chatham Trust need to vote on the stock offer, but a meeting has not yet been scheduled.The purchase does not need the approval of the Merchants stockholders. New England Merchants stock has been selling lately at about $20 per share, making the value of the 31,000 shares $620,000."
No Excuse,The American Banker,"April 3, 1979, Tuesday","To be sure, bankers must be careful as they change service charges, raise minimum balances and take other steps to make their banks more efficient. But there is nothing in the anti-inflation program that says that an inefficient operation must remain inefficient.To do nothing because of the voluntarily guidelines would be an abdication of responsibility.Retail banking is expensive and some bank policies have not reflected this.All too often, banks have priced their retail services so cheaply that the public actually is tempted to waste the bank's assets. What justification, for example, is there in giving the public an opportunity to write so many free checks for a small minimum balance that individuals write checks for 50 cents and other small amounts that would be far more efficiently handled by cash? Remembering that a bank's costs of handling one check can easily exceed 50 cents, one can see the folly of allowing the public to write checks with impunity for such small amounts.When a bank raises its service charge on small accounts so they at least help cover the costs of giving this service, this cannot be considered to be betrayal of the nation's anti-inflation program.To add evidence for such a conclusion, one should examine the entire bank, not just the one service.Some banks have taken the opportunity of the inauguration of automatic transfer service to reexamine service charges. They have given something to the depositor -- automatic transfer with the equivalent of interest on checking -- and at the same time they have taken away something --who have reasonable balances have been aided rather than hurt by the process.It also must be recognized that it is these larger depositors who make the bank's operation possible and provide the funds that enable the bank to make the loans the community wants and needs.When a bank changes service charges to aid the people who make the bank and its community more viable while at the same time penalizing those who add to its costs, this cannot be considered an inflationary step on balance. It must be examined as simply a change in service charge policy aimed at rationalizing the organization.In the same light, bankers are far better off using resources to reward savers rather than to subsidize the small checking account holder who writes checks with impunity. We have seen that demand deposits are ever becoming a smaller portion of bank funds, dropping to 11% in New York City institutions and well below the levels of the 1960s in all banks.Money spent rewarding the time and savings depositors so they keep money in the bank does far more for the bank that the same money spent subsidizing a losing checking account. And the overall picture of bank profits and charges remains anti-inflationary; for the higher charges levied on the loss items goes to help reward the group that does give the bank profits.Better costing and pricing remains a vital element of bank policy today in an era of spread management. Anything that efficiency can do to widen the spread between costs of funds and net returns earned is all to the good for the bank. To give up this vital effort because of the anti-inflationary program is merely taking an excuse to do nothing."
Wachovia Celebrates 100th Anniversary With Campaign Stressing Bank's History,The American Banker,"June 26, 1979, Tuesday","Wachovia traces its charter to 1879 and the founding of Wachovia National Bank, which merged in 1911 with Wachovia Loan and Trust Co.Because of the dominant personality of Francis Henry Fries, founder of Wachovia Loan and Trust and chief executive officer of the merged banks until his death in 1931, for years Wachovia only counted its history, at Mr. Fries' insistence, back to the founding date of his bank, 1893.The 1879 date refers to the year Wachovia National Bank was chartered in Winston, a rapidly growing, largely Democratic industrial town that had sprung up beside the austere community of Salem, a Moravian settlement dating from before the Revolutionary War.Before 1879, a succession of banks involving the same principals had provided banking services for the community of Salem, largely a conservative, Republican village with a tightly knit society. Salemhs first banking office was established in 1804.Wachovia is the Latin form of the German word ""Wachau,"" a reference to the River Valley of Austria (now Czechoslavakia) where Moravians found refuge. Moravians were Christian dissenters whose principal martyr, John Hus, was burned at the state in 1415, antedating Martin Luther.The North Carolina Moravians settled Salem after moving south from the colony of Pennsylvania. Wachovia Bank and Trust Co. has long associated itself with the frugal image of the Salem settlers, and the link was for many years peesonified by Archie K. Davis, chairman of the board from 1956 to 1974, president of the American Bankers Association in 1965-66 and virtuoso of the sousaphone in Salem's Moravian marching band to this day.To familiarize the bank's 5,350 employees with the bank's history, a campaign was organized to distribute slide presentations so they would be available to all 187 branches in 76 communities across the state.""Our No. 1 audience was the employees,"" said Jack R. Tischler, senior vice president for marketing.On the day of the massive breakfast, about 1,500 bank employees in Winston-Salem met in the cafeteria. Other gatherings were held on weekends.The slide presentations are coordinated by regional representatives, whose job it is to see that everyone wanting to see the presentation gets a chance. A special issue of the in-house monthly, ""Wachovia News,"" was entirely devoted to the bank's history, describing such things as the handguns for officers' desks that provided security in the early days.Newspaper advertisements were bought to thank, by name, individuals serving on the bank's 50 local boards of directors, six regional boards and the primary board, a total of 600 directors.A special issue of the bank's quarterly publication was devoted to the history, and sufficient interest was generated over the first few months of the year that independent publications -- like Piedmont Airlines' in-flight magazine -- produced their own stories. In coming weeks, press releases will tell of Wachovia's relationship to various aspects of North Carolina banking.For example, Wachovia's founders got their first banking experience as the result of their forming a branch of the Bank of the Cape Fear, which was chartered in 1804 as one of the two oldest banks in the state. Branching has always been allowed in North Carolona and Wachovia counts it as a major source of its strength.Also, Mr. Fries brought to the South the concept of trust banking in 1893 and Wachovia's current $5.6 billion in trust accounts managed makes it the largest trust operation in the South.The advertising spinoff, aimed at trade publications, stresses Wachovia leaders' connections with important developments in banking. For example, one describes Mr. Fries' innovations in trust banking and his admonitions about its importance to people in need of professional asset management.Another, similar ad quotes a statement made by Robert M. Hanes, who succeeded Mr. Fries as chief executive officer, serving through the Depression. Mr. Hanes was named chief of the Belgium-Luxembourg mission of the Economic Cooperation Administration -- a post-World War Two aid mission -- in 1949.Mr. Hanes was Wachovia's first ABA president, serving in 1939-40.To mount the effort at education and promotion related to the bank's history, Mr. Tischler said, the bank first considered hiring an advertising agency and then concluded ""they could not provide for us anything we couldn't do for ourselves.""A spokesman for the bank said that the vault and archives produced ""literally hundreds"" of pictures as well as money printed by the bank and wealth of material from the Depression days when Wachovia had offices in six North Carlina communities -- and was at one point the only bank open in those six communities.""Our No. 1 goal as far as reach is concerned has been our employees,"" Mr. Tischler said. ""But you can't close down, put a sign on the door and say you've all gone to a picnic."""
Okla. Regulator Choice Awaits End of Legislative Session,The American Banker,"March 29, 1979, Thursday","""I will not have any Bank Commission appointment -- period,"" he said, ""until after the legislative session.""He said he did not want anyone named to fill the vacancy created in late 1978 by the resignation of Harry E. Leonard to have to feel the pressures associated in the current bank structure fight before the Senate and House.Mr. Nigh also has hinted he would veto Senate Bill 246, the multibank holding company and branch banking measure which has passed the Senate by a 25-21 margin, if the House also passes the same bill.The bill, authored and introduced by Sen. Lee Cate, D., Norman, would radically change Oklahoma's unit banking law. It has been assigned to the House banks and banking committee for consideration.""I haven't seen the bill which passed the Senate,"" said the Governor. ""I have read about it however. On the basic concept of multibank holding companies, I would not have supported it.""""If the bill comes out with amendments, compromises or emerges as a new bill, then I would have to look at that,"" he added.His comments represented the first official statements on Oklahoma bank structure. Oklahoma law permits one extended facility, a drive-in, which must be within 1,000 feet of the main bank office.In the Senate vote, the decision favoring the Cate bill represented the minimum vote necessary in the 48-member upper house. Oklahoma is one of three states forbidding branch banking.The bill, which drew early opposition from House Speaker Daniel D. Draper Jr., D., Stillwater, provides for multiple ownership of banks and would allow a single bank holding company to control up to 10% of the total state bank deposits.It originally would have permitted control up to 12% of total deposits, but was amended on the Senate floor.Multibank holding companies, under provision of the bill, would be permitted to operate only in counties of more than 29,000 populations. Twenty-five of the state's 77 counties would be able to have such multibank holding companies.The Senate-passed bill also contains a limited branching provision and would permit one branch bank anywhere in the corporate limits of the bank's home city, and a second branch in a community without a bank, if that community is within a 30-mile radius of the main bank's home city.The Cate bill, as passed, would not permit limited branches in the state's two most populated counties, Tulsa and Oklahoma.Since passage, Mr. Draper has said he is ""uncommitted"" on the measure, but House majority leader Vernon Dunn, D., Loco, said he will oppose the bill because he cannot see anything wrong with the way state banks operate at present.""If the plan is for a few bankers to control all the money in the state, I couldn't ever be for it,"" Mr. Dunn said.The deadline for reporting Senate measures from House committees is april 12, and the deadline for action by the full House on Senate bills is May 3.And even if it passes the House, it is due consideration by a joint Senate-House committee. A motion by Sen. Roy A. Boatner, D., Calera, chairman of the Senate banks and banking committee, crippled the Cate bill's title, meaning if it does pass the House it must go conference committee which will recommend the final form of the bill to both houses."
Puerto Rico: Economic Review and Perspective,The American Banker,"March 16, 1979, Friday","During 1977, the economy grew at a slow pace which gathered strength as the year advanced. It was in 1978 that this strength was evidenced in several key sectors. Construction grew in various indices. Permits were up by 23.3%, to $444 million. VA mortgages were up by 49.3%. Construction employment also increased substantially.Tourism had a very good year. Non-resident registrations and expenditures grew by 12.6% and $17.9% respectively. Reflecting this improvement, the number of hotel rooms available also grew by 8.6%, a reversal of an adverse trend that had been in effect for some years.Puerto Rico's economic mainstay, manufacturing, also showed improvement. The number of jobs increased by 5,800, a modest but encouraging 4%. Payrolls in this sector grew by 12.5%, from $666.2 to $749.3 billion. Commerce, particularly retail sales, showed good increases. Department store sales went up by 11.4%.Agriculture showed modest improvement, particularly in the production of beef, eggs, and poultry. Sugarcane production continued its downward trend by declining some 10.8%.The island's labor force grew to 993,000 by 5.2%. There was some reduction in the unemployed, to 185,000. It is a still high 18.6% of the labor force.During 1978 the Government Development Bank continued its fiscal activities to improve the debt position of the Commonwealth and its instrumentalities. Several important issues were successfully marketed. Among these were issues of Public Buildings Authority ($110 million), Puerto Rico Telephone Co. ($100 million), P.R. Water Resources Authority ($125 million), and Commonwealth Government General Obligations ($100 million).The successful selling of these and other issues evidenced the renewed confidence of mainland investors in Puerto Rico's economy and government. To this must be added the active participation of the island's financial community. Local investors, including banks and 936 corporations, acquired substantial portions of several issues, chiefly one of the Municipality of San Juan for $20 million, and a $50 million note issue by the Government Development Bank tailored to 936 corporations.For the first time, three recently-created financial arms of the GDB went to the market and successfully placed their issues. The P.R. Industrial and Environmental Control Facilities Financial Authority -- AFICA -- raised $23.5 million, the Housing Finance Corporation obtained $31.2 and $32.1 million in two issues, and the P R Development Fund raised $25 million in notes. These three instrumentalities are geared toward servicing specific capital market segments, and their now modest activities could become significant and of economic impact in the near future.Particularly noteworthy was the signing of a $650 million note purchase agreement last December between twelve commercial banks and nine bond-issuing agencies, providing short-term, interim facilities for their capital expenditures programs during the next five years.In the banking segment, there has been an improvement in financial strength and liquidity of commercial banks. Both deposits and loans grew in 1978 by 20.9% and 10.2% respectively, reflecting the improved economic conditions in the Island. Deposits of 936 corporations in Puerto Rico, in particular, continued to be a key factor in maintaining the banking system's favorable liquidity. Capital accounts continued to increase, up 8.7% during the year, with an improving profit picture.The outlook for 1979 remains good. It should be a year of continued economic growth, although at a slower pace than last year. Most observers predict a growth in gross product of 4% to 5%. As in the past, this growth should be sustained mainly by manufacturing, and to a lesser degree tourism and other economic sectors which are dependent on Federal expenditures.Manufacturing in Puerto Rico depends to a large degree on economic conditions in the U.S. mainland. To the extent that a slowdown in the U.S. economy does not take place until late this year, the Puerto Rican manufacturing community should enjoy vigorous activity through 1979. There are, however, uncertainties which temper this forecast. Chief among these are the impact of high interest rates, inflation, the higher minimum wages, and the increase in oil prices. Changes in the local tax exemption law, in effect doing away with 100% tax exemption for new manufacturing activity, do not seem to have much of a negative impact on new industrial promotions and expansions.Federal spending will probably be affected by the fiscal 1980 budget recently announced by President Carter. It is too early to determine how this will affect Puerto Rico's programs.However, any impact will be felt after 1979, as committments of funds for this year are already firm. Construction should continue strong, with $1.4 billion programmed through fiscal 1979.Most of this is taking place in the public sector, with very little private construction. Budgetary limitations, particularly in Federal programs, should place limitations in this type of activity for the immediate future years. Sales, particularly retail sales, should grow with other segments of the economy. At 5% to 10% increase is predicted for the current fiscal year. This sector is aided by substantial Federal transfer payments to island residents, and therefore subject to the impact budget reductions may have on these payments.The banking community looks forward to another good year for our banks. The growth that took place during 1978 in such key factors as deposits, loans, and capital accounts, should be sustained. With continued strength and liquidity, our banks will remain in a position to continue serving our economy's needs.To sum up, the outlook for Puerto Rico's economy in 1979 is optimistic, although tempered by several factors that may have a negative impact late this year. With solid expectations for manufacturing, tourism, and construction, our economic momentum should produce an over-all good year.""The outlook for 1979 remains good. It should be a year of continued economic growth, although at a slower pace than last year."""
IRS Probes of CU Tax Status May Have Implications for Other Fin. Institutions,The American Banker,"January 5, 1979, Friday","The IRS is doing something here which could turn out to be not so amusing because it might not end at the credit union movement.The situation briefly is this. Some time last year, the IRS sent letters to some state-chartered credit unions warning them that if they did a substantial share-draft business, they could have their tax-exempt status revoked.The IRS reasoned that a substantial volume of share-draft activity suggested that a CU was getting away from its primary responsibility to promote thrift, and in fact was getting into the banking business, and, therefore, it should be taxed the same as a bank.This made state credit union supervisors roaring mad which resulted in a letter from the National Association of State Credit Union Supervisors accusing the IRS of trying to pre-empt the right of states to define the nature of a credit union.So far, it is a tiff between the IRS and the CUs, and essentially is a states' rights argument, but bank and thrift institution lawyers are watching it with interest.No one quite remembers the IRS moving into the financial community in this fashion. The fundamental question its action poses is to what extent the government can use the tax status of a financial institution to alter its function?Although other financial institutions have no tax exemption like the CUs, they do have tax concessions such as the bad debt reserve granted because of their specialized role in our society -- perhaps, the thrift institutions more so than the banks.If, in fact, the IRS is trying to set a precedent here, it is not too far-fetched to see it extended to other financial institutions.For instance, the IRS fired off those letters after the CUs started pumping out the check-like share drafts, which was a new sector the CUs elbowed their way into in recent months.This is hardly unique. Banks and thrift institutions always are pushing hard at their boundaries, straining existing laws as much as possible, and trying to lobby through new ones to add more services and competitive tools.Question: Does this mean that the IRS now will begin monitoring all new powers granted to each financial institution to determine whether it distracts from the purpose for which the institution was created, and if so, recommend a change in its tax status?There's another side of this that also makes the lobbies uneasy. The IRS last year asked Congress to tax credit unions, but the politicians rejected the idea.To some, what the IRS is doing now is using its muscle to compensate for its lack of persuasive powers.Although the IRS is quite able to create a state of terror among business lobbies by the mere drop of a regulation, this particular situation has not reached that state.It is noted that the IRS' only attempt to revoke the tax-exempt status of a state-chartered credit union was turned down by a New Hampshire court. Also, there is still no hard proof that the agency is embarked on a precedential action in this instance. It could be just a probe merely to test the legal and political resistance generated by this issue.But the move is being observed carefully in the financial community, and not just by the credit unions."
Top-Level Consumer Focus Urged,The American Banker,"February 13, 1979, Tuesday","Furthermore, they said, a failure on the part of regulators to provide better guidance to the financial industry could lead to unintentional violations, costly lawsuits, greater distrust by the public, and additional layers of unnecessary regulations. ""There's so much difference in the interpretations of the laws, you've got some real problems, said B. J. Stelling, vice president of United Bank of Boulder, Colorado, in an interview.""You can really get nailed to the wall,"" he added.""You see how many judgment decisions there are,"" said Charles L. Childers, president of Tyler Bank & Trust, in Tyler, Tex., in explaining the Community Reinvestment Act to the gathering.""You can really get nailed to the wall,"" he added.""You see how many judgment decisions there are,"" said Charles L. Childers, president of Tyler Bank & Trust, in Tyler Tex., in explaining the Community Reinvestment Act to the gathering.""You have to go ahead and bite the bullet,"" Mr. Childers told them.Peter D. Schellie, an attorney with Bakers & Daniels in Washington, warned the ABA's first National Conference on Consumer Compliance conference that noncompliance with consumer legislation can result in ""liabilities that are so great,"" that it can become an issue of safety and soundness for financial institutions.The ABA described the conference as one designed to help senior management ""develop a systematic and effective compliance program."" It also provided a forum for many officials to share experiences, concerns and prophecies about banking in the age of consumerism.The bankers listened to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation director William M. Issac say that the Federal regulators want only a ""good faith effort"" by the financial industry in complying with Community Reinvestment Act.None the less, many said in interviews and group sessions that they are not confident the Federal regulators will provide adequate assistance to help them overcome problems with compliance.In addition to complaints about unnecessary paperwork and reporting requirements, they spoke of inconsistent appraisals of policy matters within and among the bank regulatory agencies.Douglas W. Fuller, assistant vice president of Union Trust Co. in New Haven, Conn., said in an interview that too many consumer laws had ""built-in Catch 22s"" and attempts to have the agencies reconcile complications often proved fruitless. He recalled one case where he sought the advice of the Federal Reserve Board but the agency ""talked all around"" a solution to the problem before ruling that no decision was necessary because his bank's concerns ""were academic"".One bankers asked Mr. Isaac about ""reverse discrimination"" against banks caused by many provisions of the consumer laws.Others said in interviews that many regulations intended to protect consumers are actually hurting them.Cyril F. Gill, senior vice president Colonial First National Bank, Red Bank, N. J., said in an interview that difficulties with disclosure requirements led the bank to cancel plans which would have enabled consumers to ""skip a month"" at the end of each 12 months of loan payments.Mr. Fuller of Union Trust in New Haven said his bank once planned loans with initial interest rates that later could be reduced ""as a reward"" to those debtors who meet certain standards for repayment.Mr. Fuller said ""we just dropped the whole idea"" because of complications concerning disclosure requirements.Other bankers said they feared certain consumers might be denied loans because bankers would be unwilling to risk charges of discrimination.Glenn Y. Forney, president and chief executive officer of the $99.6 million-deposit Security Bank & Trust Co., Stroudsburg, Pa., said many future ""success stories"" might be lost because bankers will be fearful of taking risks based on hunches and character assessments rather than statistical credit ratings.""If you have a suspicion about charac"" ter,"" Mr. Forney said, ""then . . . how do you score that and how do you cite it?""""In today's market, if you take that risk outside the normal guidelines with one fellow and not with the next, you've discriminated,"" he said.Mr. Stelling of United Bank of Boulder said he agreed. He said the government is unrealistically trying to ""pick a model citizen and clone the rest of the world after that . . . I don't see that that's what credit is all about.""Many bankers said they were frustrated that Congress, the regulators, and consumer groups have shown an increasing antagonism toward the industry.Several speakers at the conference urged that the best way bankers could overcome much of the public distrust of the industry is to lobby for better regulations.Virginia M. Grose, vice president of the $972.9 million-deposit South Carolina National Bank in Columbia, cited a government suggestion concerning the solicitation of consumer complaints in bank lobbies as one which actually translated to mean: ""what have we done to tick you off today.""Despite the many fears and frustrations expressed by bankers in attendance, speakers at the conference called for a positive attitude toward consumer compliance.Robert W. Renner, president of the $33.7 million-deposit Citizens State Bank, Hartford City, Ind., told the gathering that in working with his staff, ""I don't want to hear a lot of griping that we can't do this and we can't do that and it's not fun.""Mr. Renner said his ""principal job is encouragement to my staff.""Mr. Shellie of Baker & Daniels, whose wrapup closed the three-day session, said ""Senior management attitudes showing leadership to meeting these problems. . . will make or break any program I've ever seen or ever could imagine.""s"
Mrs. Miller Would Enlarge FHLBB,The American Banker,"November 20, 1979, Tuesday","In a farewell interview, Mrs. Miller expressed strong ideas about the industry she has helped to regulate and the agency of which she has been a part, and said she was optimistic about the future of both.However, Mrs. Miller also sees a need for both to undergo a few changes.She said she believes the FHLBB should be increased to five from three members to more effectively regulate the thrift industry.Mrs. Miller said the regulatory responsibility of the FHLBB has greatly increased since the board was established in the 1930s, and consequently the three-member system is outdated.""The chairman's job here is grueling,"" she said. ""The fact that the board has such a high turnover rate indicates that a five-person board would have more stability.""She suggested that the FHLBB adopt a structure similar to that of the sevenmember Federal Reserve Board, whose governors divide responsibility for specific areas.The departing FHLBB member is soft spoken and chooses her words carefully.Speaking of the state of the industry, Mrs. Miller said S&Ls will have to make some adjustments to achieve their full financial potential.""The board has created the options for the industry to do well, ""she said, ""but the industry will have to change its operations.""""It can't just take in savings and make mortgages any more. Savings and loans must do more long-term liability planning.""The need for such planning was increased, Mrs. Miller said, by a recent FHLBB action which expanded the industry's outside borrowing capabilities.""Those (associations) developing techniques to seek funds from a variety of sources and rotating those funds are going to do the best,"" Mrs. Miller said.In conjunction with increased borrowing ability, the FHLBB has given thrift institutions new mortgage tools through which these funds can be ""rotated."" These new lending instruments include graduated-payment mortgages, variablerate mortgages, and co-op loans.Savings and loans must adopt an aggressive attitude in using new tools with which the FHLBB equips them, Mrs. Miller said, particularly ""if and when"" they get new consumer lending powers.She added that thrifts must begin to rely more heavily on secondary mortgage markets.Smaller S&Ls, she said, might need some help in adapting to policy changes. She suggested that the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.'s policy of helping minority S&Ls increase their participation in the secondary mortgage market can be expanded to provide other types of technical assistance to small institutions to help them meet the challenges of a changing industry.When Mrs. Miller announced her resignation she received a number of letters from members of the industry, civil rights groups, and congressmen. The letters thanked her for her service on the board, saying she achieved long-needed changes.When asked for an opinion of Mrs. Miller's tenure, a savings and loan trade association staffer said Mrs. Miller ""turned out to be a real advocate, in a positive way, of the savings and loan industry.""Mrs. Miller's strongest contributions, he said, came as a result of her commitment to inner-city lending.The FHLBB enacted a nondiscrimination regulation for S&Ls and simultaneously created a $10 billion Community Investment Fund while Mrs. Miller served on the board.Mrs. Miller, taking little credit for the FHLBB's actions to encourage compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act, said that 25% of the S&L industry is involved in the CIF program. About $3 billion of the fund is ""already out working"" in inner-city communities, she said.Mrs. Miller also has been praised for her efforts to deregulate the industry and for her willingness to discuss any issue openly.""She was a good person for the job,"" summarized the trade agency staffer.Mrs. Miller, who has served one and one-half years of a four-year term, will return to the Ford Foundation in New York City, where she was senior program officer for six years in the department of urban and metropolitan development, division of national affairs.Mrs. Miller said that she is leaving the FHLBB because the weekly commute from her home in Manhattan to her Washington office is too burdensome. Although Mrs. Miller notes she would have stayed with board had she been named chairman, she stresses she is not leaving in a huff."
