Alumni Association increases community involvement,Houstonian: Sam Houston State University,"January 1, 1970 Thursday","""The events that we set up for Homecoming, the number one objective was what can we do to keep students here, provide fun activities for them, as well as bring alumni back to campus,"" said Hayes.The first event will be the Sam Jam Carnival and M4 Simulator Wednesday night at 8 p.m. in the Johnson Coliseum parking lot. On Oct. 25, there will be four more events focusing on alumni. Beginning at 11 a.m., there will be a Golden Circle Luncheon in the LSC ballroom, followed by the dedication of the Alumni garden at 2 p.m. Night events will be held at the LSC ballroom including the Distinguished Alumni Gala Reception at 6 p.m. and the Gala Dinner at 7 p.m.It's a very intimate setting,"" said Chrissy Price of Alumni Relations.Game day will be different from past SHSU Homecomings. The date itself is earlier in the year and the parade will no longer be held during the week, but on Saturday.""Dr. Gaertner had set up a traditions committee and just to explore some of the traditions that Sam Houston has had and to see if we can start to incorporate them with some of our events. One of them is to move the parade to Saturday,"" said Hayes.Hayes served as a homecoming parade judge last year and was astonished that community members at neighboring businesses had no idea that the parade was occurring. He was approached and asked what was going on by a community member.""I informed her that this was SHSU Homecoming parade and right then I said to myself, 'this is the problem.' There's no reason why we can't make a bigger parade and get the community involved,"" said Hayes.The theme ""Paint the Town Orange"" can be taken literal since student organizations are encouraged to go out and ask permission of businesses to paint store windows orange, generating SHSU spirit.""We're hoping that the businesses and the students become better acquainted with this effort, too,"" said Hayes.Saturday events will begin at 7:30 a.m. with a 5K Raven run in the HKC. At 8 a.m. in Austin Hall, there will be an Alumni Coffee in which all are encouraged to come and have coffee. ""We hope to have tons of people turn out at Austin Hall,"" said Price.The parade will begin at 9 a.m. and will start at Bowers Boulevard, travel down Sam Houston Avenue, turn right on 12th Street and end at the Regent parking lot. Following the parade is the traditional home game concert and tailgate party at noon with food, games and entertainment at Bowers Stadium. The game is at 2 p.m. when SHSU takes on McNeese State.""Again, I think the committees objective is to encourage a lot of student participation as well as alumni,"" said Hayes."
Sigma Tau Gamma receives awards,Houstonian: Sam Houston State University,"January 1, 1970 Thursday","The chapter received the Most Improved Chapter award at the conclave. Scott Magee, the president of Sigma Tau Gamma, received the leadership award, and Cheryl Thomas, Sigma Tau Gamma White Rose, received the ""Best White Rose"" award.Cashion said these awards are highly sought after and the competition is very steep. ""There were chapters from Arizona, Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi who were nominated for these awards, "" Cashion said. ""But our chapter won, and that is a great triumph."" Cashion said the chapter members have been working very hard doing various community service projects and their tireless have efforts paid off.Cashion also said this is the perfect time for people to know about the fraternity's awards and activities. ""A lot of things have been going on lately with fraternities, and these guys have done considerable community service projects and are showing people that fraternities are not about having parties and drinking,"" Cashion said. One of the community service projects the fraternity did in the fall was called ""Cabin Fever."" The members helped transport an old, run-down log cabin to the town square, disassemble it and then rebuild it. Cashion said the fraternity members have really turned the chapter around. ""They have higher GPAs and the awards have definitely boosted their sense of accomplishment,"" he said.Cashion said the fraternity members are good examples of what college students should be like. ""They are hard workers, involved in the community, and are having fun while getting an education,"" Cashion said. ""That's what the college experience is about."""
"Businesses kick off ""Spirit of Huntsville"" food drive benefiting Good Shephard Mission",Houstonian: Sam Houston State University,"January 1, 1970 Thursday","""Recent events have prompted all of us to remember to pitch in and help those around us,"" said Brooke Addams, KSAM/Oldies Radio 1490 operations manager.The community can make non-perishable food donations at Brookshire Brothers on 11th Street and Normal Park from 3 p.m. to 8 p.m. on Saturday and from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Sunday.Addams said the goal is to raise enough food to last through the holidays and into 2002. KSAM morning radio personality Kooter Robertson will be counting on the community to come through. Of all KSAM radio personalities, listeners voted for him to go ""Sky High for Hunger"" and be hoisted into the air on a cherry picker andheld hostage until the goal is reached. Except for the occasional bathroom break, he will not be allowed to come down.""That's the fun of it! People can come out and see Kooter in the cherry picker and feel sorry for him,"" Addams said. ""But the reality of it is that the 'pain and inconvenience' he's undergoing for two days is small compared to the pain of hundreds of our neighbors and their children going through the holidays with empty stomachs. No child deserves that.""Addams is confident the community will come through and Robertson will be released.""We never considered not reaching our goal, so there's no 'Plan B,'"" she said. ""But we'll be nice enough to let him down.""The food drive kicked off Nov. 10 by accepting donations at the ""Fire Up the Bearkats"" Tailgate Party, which collected almost $200 plus about 200 cans of food, Addams said.She added that she is excited other members in the community heard about the food drive on the radio and decided to help. Pizza Pro will supply food to volunteers and will accept non-perishable food donations when making deliveries.The newly crowned Miss Walker County, Crystyl Swanson, Miss Sam Houston-Huntsville, Sabrina Markle and Miss Teen Walker County Cassie Fausett will be there helping out and autographing pictures. Also, the Davy Crocket Riders will make an ""entrance"" and a donation Saturday.For more information call KSAM/Oldies Radio 1490 at 295-2651."
The days of integration,Houstonian: Sam Houston State University,"January 1, 1970 Thursday","Baker was the first speaker in a new lecture series hosted by the Academic Support Programs of the SAM Center at Sam Houston State University. The series is entitled, ""Grassroots: Conversations on Leadership in a Diverse Community."" Baker's presentation was held last night in the Olson Auditorium in Academic Building 4.Baker told stories about how he spread awareness of the importance of voting for black citizens and how he helped to change SHSU from an all-white, segregated school to a fully integrated university.As a young man, Baker was allowed to work the voting polls as a poll watcher after much opposition. Baker said the chairman of the party opposed him working at the poll, and told him he was not qualified to do it. However, this did not stop Baker from fulfilling his dream.""There is no need to be afraid of the opposition because often they are cowards themselves,"" he said.Eventually, Baker was sworn in as a poll watcher, and helped the voting staff to identify the blind, bedridden and disabled people who would not normally vote without assistance.""We voted all kinds of people,"" he said.Baker said he began to notice that the number of blacks voting was slim compared to the population of blacks in the community. He said the population consisted of 42 percent, which was about 2,000 people. He said there were normally only about 12,000 to 15,000 who actually voted.""The voting system was so controlled that many of my people believed that their votes did not count,"" Baker said. ""The solution was to get them to start voting.""Baker said when the Supreme Court issued a law saying that black people would be able to vote in the primaries, the elections where the main decisions were made, things began to change.""We organized many people,"" Baker said. ""As leaders, we are to find out who and where our followers are.""Baker said he invited 40 people who were leaders in the community to a meeting where they would decide how to persuade the black population to vote.""Every one of them promised they would attend,"" Baker said. ""However, only eight were in attendance, including me. I talked with the people that were there, and told them that we needed to make a difference.""It saddened me that I fought overseas for a democracy I could not come home and participate in. If something didn't change, my children were not going to be able to participate, either,"" he said.Baker said he sent the leaders who attended the meeting to talk to the ones that did not attend so the vision would be spread across the community. He said as a result, 65 percent of the black population voted during the next election.Baker told students and faculty, ""Don't let anyone tell you that your vote doesn't count. The only way it doesn't count is when you choose not to participate.""Baker not only spread awareness for black citizens to vote in Huntsville, he also played a large role in the integration of Sam Houston State University.Baker partnered with the NAACP in a lawsuit against SHSU in the early '60s and the Supreme Court immediately made a decision to integrate the university after an article concerning the suit appeared in the Houston Chronicle. In 1964, the Supreme Court passed legislation to integrate SHSU and the surrounding institutions. and the first black student to attend the university was John Patrick.""I feel so proud when I stop at a stop light on the campus grounds and see the spectrum of students that walk along the crosswalk,"" Baker said. ""That is my payback.""Baker also encouraged students to get the most out of their education.""Don't just sit in class and get by,"" he said. ""Learn what it takes to develop yourself.""Students who attended Baker's presentation said he was an inspiration to them.""Mr. Baker was very interesting to listen to,"" freshman Katie Wogen said. ""It is always great to learn more about the history of Sam Houston State.""""Mr. Baker reminds me of another great leader, E.D. Nixon,"" freshman Josselyn Kennedy said. ""Baker and Nixon are two men that saw how important the gathering of the black community was when standing against segregation.""Recently, the House of Representatives of the 77th Texas Legislature passed a resolution honoring Baker and the many contributions he has made.The resolution states, ""The House of Representatives of the 77th Texas Legislature hereby honor Wendell Baker, Sr., on his lifetime of contributions to the Huntsville community and the State of Texas and extend to him sincere best wishes for happiness and good fortune in his future endeavors. Mr. Baker has had a positive impact on countless people, and it is most appropriate to pay tribute to him."""
Education officials to launch new college campaign,Houstonian: Sam Houston State University,"January 1, 1970 Thursday","Frank Parker, associate vice president for Student Services, will be the keynote speaker at the event in Huntsville.Trevor Thorne with SHSU Admissions, and student Erica Susilier will also speak.Four million dollars of the total $5 million state funding is earmarked to research a target audience and launch a mass media campaign to get the message of higher education to the citizens of Texas.""Mainly, we're targeting first generation students, especially in the Hispanic and African-American communities,"" White said. ""Although the number of secondary education students in these groups is growing, the percentage in comparison to population growth rate is dropping.""Partnerships are also being formed with various community service and faith-based organizations to implement permanent programs at the community level.""We have dozens of dozens of partners...hundreds statewide, of faith-based organizations, public schools, the United Way, Girl and Boy Scouts and many others,"" White said.According to campaign literature, one million Texans are enrolled in higher education, which represents about 5 percent of the state's total population. This is lower than rates in New York, California, Michigan and Illinois.If current trends continue, the annual household income of Texans will drop an estimated $30 to $40 billion by 2030. This could have disastrous consequences for both Texas families and the state's economy.""We are offering a $500 mini-grant to any community organization to outreach and to take on the higher education message. Information is available on our Web site,"" White said.The marketing part of the effort will include a massive media campaign; the outreach portion will help establish the network of partners to inform and motivate citizens to pursue higher education.Information will also be provided on various forms of funding available to secondary education students.Supporters of the campaign believe that higher education maximizes available life-choices and is attainable and affordable. Through research, advertising and grassroots outreach, they hope to motivate students and those who influence students."
RTV Department olds toy drive,Houstonian: Sam Houston State University,"January 1, 1970 Thursday","""We just want to do something for the community,"" said Rosati. ""Radio is not just for entertainment, but to help the community as well.""The RTV toy drive started on Nov. 9 and is looking for ""gently used or new toys"" or monetary donations to help families at the mission, located at 1001 Ave. F in Huntsville. However, donations so far are below expectations explained Rosati. People have donated, but not a whole lot she said, speculating that events surrounding Sept. 11 may be keeping some from donating.The toy drive put on by RTV is part of a larger, community-based effort to supply needy families with Christmas gifts for their children.""We've been doing this for 13 years,"" said Rev. Jerome Brimmage, pastor for Wesley United Methodist Church, which handles the distribution of the toys every year.""People will begin to line up around 2 a.m. to 3 a.m. the morning before the giveaway,"" said Brimmage.This year the giveaway will be held on Dec. 15 from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m.""We also give hot chocolate and cookies to people standing in line,"" Brimmage said.In order to be eligible to receive the toys, families must be signed up with The Good Shepherd Mission, which was created by the Minister Alliance to serve the community, explained Brimmage.The overall project, called Santa's Helpers, provides about 350-400 children with toys for Christmas. ""We have boxes around town,"" said Brimmage, ""and Wal-Mart helps out a lot, as well as other churches. Wiesner also helps out with a bicycle drive. ""About 2000 toys are usually gathered annually said Brimmage, with the children receiving about five to six toys each.Brimmage, who has been here for four years, said the day of the giveaway is total joy.""I talked to children before and after they came in. When they left,"" he said, ""they were grinning from ear to ear.""Toys are given out according to the age of the child, with the most popular toys being stuffed animals, Barbie dolls, and bicycles, which have a waiting list. Brimmage said they're typically low on toys for their oldest age group, the 10- to 14-year-olds.To drop off toys to the RTV department, stop by Room 123 of the Dan Rather Building, said Rosati, who can be reached at 294-1342 for more information."
"Theater opens in downtown Huntsville, showing movie this weekend",Houstonian: Sam Houston State University,"January 1, 1970 Thursday","One hundred thousand dollars was raised to match a challenge grant from Lu Ellen Gibbs and Mary Laura Gibbs, enabling the group to purchase the building, which would be the new home for the Huntsville Community Theatre, on Oct. 1, 1998.Serious renovations had to be made due to the condition of the theater. A program guide from the theater's open house gives the details of its history.""The Town Theatre began its operation as motion picture venue in 1947 and continued showing movies of all kinds until 1974 when it closed its doors as a movie house. A variety of personality changes occurred after 1974 as the facility served as a broom and mop manufacturing site, a traffic light assembly plant, and finally Pokey's Beer Parlor that was 'open air' as result of a paint booth fire in the assembly operation. During the open-air period, Town Theatre served as home for hundreds of downtown Huntsville's thriving pigeon population.""So far, Myrick said the theatre is so new only a few shows are scheduled in the near future.For its first live performance feature, the theater will show ""The Magic Flute"" presented by the SHSU School of Music. The performance is scheduled for March 21 and 22 at 7:30 p.m. Regular admission is $8 and $6 for students, senior citizens and children. On April 13, the SHSU Chamber Orchestra will perform, said Myrick, and then on April 25, the Huntsville Youth Orchestra will play.In the first week of May, the Huntsville Community Theatre will open the season at its new home with ""Nunsense,"" a musical comedy by Dan Goggin.On May 24 and 25, students from Huntsville public schools will put on a performance. Also starting in May, Odgen's Country Jubilee, a music group will begin to perform regular shows the third Saturday of every month.""That about all we've got planed for now,"" Myrick said.According to Myrick, the theater has 350 seats, including a balcony of 100 seats. Films will be played using a DVD projector.Saturday's showing of ""He Was Houston"" is free and open to anyone who would like to attend.The documentary is the conclusion of a series of events planned for March 2 all over Huntsville celebrating Sam Houston's birthday, which includes a march and a series of presentations."
Kaldi's cuts the ribbon for grand opening,Houstonian: Sam Houston State University,"January 1, 1970 Thursday","Kaldi's Coffee House, located at 1627 Sam Houston Ave, opened its doors on April 1. Following the ribbon cutting yesterday, a grand opening ceremony for the entire Huntsville community will be held on May 1.Huntsville-Walker County Chamber of Commerce President Dee McFarland was on hand along with other Chamber members to witness the ceremony.""I think it's exciting, we've been looking for something like this for a long time,"" McFarland said. ""We love how they refurbished the building, and totally revitalized the property that was here.""McFarland said Huntsville is happy to have Kaldi's as a new business in the city.""We welcome them as a new business to town, and we hope everyone stops by to get a coffee,"" McFarland said.Kaldi's gets its name from a story concerning an Ethiopian goat herder named Kaldi who supposedly discovered coffee beans after noticing his goats were more energetic after grazing on strange beans.The coffee shop is owned and operated by Rick Francis along with his wife Indiana.Francis said he wanted to open the coffee house in Huntsville because he saw a demand for one in the community. He added that he hopes Huntsville residents will use Kaldi's as a place to meet and discuss subjects, issues and other interests.""We want everyone to feel like this is a second home,"" Francis said.The coffee shop is located in the building that housed former businesses such as Bad Boys Burritos and Angelo's Pizza. Despite the closings of previous restaurants in the location, Francis said he feels Kaldi's will be successful.""We're very confident and optimistic in our location,"" Francis said. ""We believe this is the right location for a coffee house.""Francis said he has made numerous improvements to building, such as installing more windows and lights, as well as other renovations to the plumbing system and parking lot. The kitchen area and counter have also been moved further back to allow more space in the middle of the coffee house for customers.Also, Francis has installed a patio behind the building where coffee shop customers can go to drink their beverages in a quieter atmosphere. The patio features tables and seating and also has a mural painted along the back wall which was drawn by SHSU art major Kathy Gould.Francis said the total cost for renovation and furnishing the coffee shop came to about $100,000.Francis said the coffee shop has been popular so far, and there is every indication that the business will do just fine. Along with serving coffee and other beverages, Francis said Kaldi's is very open to poetry readings and acoustic music performances. While there are currently no set plans, he said many people have inquired about having such events at the coffee house.Sophomore Zara Porter works at Kaldi's and said it was the coffee business itself that encouraged her to seek employment at the coffee house.""I saw an article in The Houstonian, and I thought I'd like to work in a coffee house because I like coffee and I like the environment of coffee shops,"" Porter said. ""I thought it would be fun.""Francis said he looks forward to the future of Kaldi's in Huntsville.""We really appreciate everyone's support; faculty, students and staff and the community,"" Francis said. ""We really enjoy being part of the Huntsville community."""
Plans set for facility additions,Houstonian: Sam Houston State University,"January 1, 1970 Thursday","The College of Business Administration is planning to create a new addition to the Smith-Hutson Business Building that will roughly double its existing workspace.R. Dean Lewis, dean of the College of Business Administration, said the construction would extend to the parking lot south of the building, and create new faculty offices and classroom space. A new auditorium that will hold 158 people will also be added next to the existing Ronald P. Mafrige Auditorium.""We have faculty in three buildings; we have classrooms in two,"" Lewis said. ""We're out of space; that's why we're getting the additions.""The Smith-Hutson Building currently has 45,000 square feet of workspace, but the construction will add an additional 42,000 square feet. The project will cost approximately $38.5 million, and should begin next year.""""It's expected to start by January of '04,"" Lewis said. ""We should be in the building by fall '05.""Lewis said the project is still in the planning phases, particularly the architectural aspects. The locations of columns, lights, computer ports and podiums still need to be decided. He said the actual office spaces and classrooms are pretty much set.The College of Business Administration originally planned to renovate the existing building, but after consulting the projected growth estimates for the college, decided new space was needed. The addition will be three stories tall with all floors accessible from the existing building.The first and third floor will be mostly classroom space, and the second floor will be primarily faculty offices. There is also room set aside for departmental suites, student and teacher lounges and study areas. When completed, the additions will allow for 14 extra classrooms and 38 new offices, allowing most of the faculty and students to be centralized in one building.""We're going to get everyone together,"" Lewis said. ""The faculty and classes in one building. We need the classes very badly.""Lewis added that with the current growth rate, the additions would probably keep the university's business students and faculty satisfied for the next eight to 10 years, and that extra space will probably still be reserved in Academic Building One to accommodate extra students.""I think we will continue our growth trend, which will benefit the college and the university,"" Lewis said.Also scheduled for renovation is the Teacher Education Center, which will have a new wing added to help accommodate facilities for a new doctorate program in counseling education now offered by SHSU.Genevieve Brown, dean of the College of Education and Applied Science, said the college was planning to add the new doctorate program even without the new space, but will take advantage of the new space to house the needed facilities.""It will have a clinic where doctoral and master's students will counsel members of the community,"" Brown said. ""Children, teenagers and family, a free service to the community.""The funds for the project came from a fund designated for construction purposes. Brown said the project is still in a bid process, but that construction will probably begin in late spring and the new facility won't be operable before spring 2004.The new extension will head out towards Johnson Coliseum. Brown said the college's new wing would help expand the amount of clinical help the college provides to the Huntsville community.""We do it now on a limited basis, but now we'll be able to meet new needs in the community,"" said Brown."
Folk singer Ari Hest to perform at Lowman Student Center Friday,Houstonian: Sam Houston State University,"January 1, 1970 Thursday","The talented folk singer has traveled on tour with big name musicians, opening for artists such as Dave Matthews and John Mayer,Hest is now on his own national tour promoting his new, recently released album, ""Story After Story.""After stops in Dallas and Austin, the tour stops at SHSU. Hest's stop in Huntsville will mark his second trip to town. He previously played Huntsville in September 2002.The concert is being brought to SHSU by the Huntsville Concert Series, an organization developed in 2002 with the purpose of bringing a variety of different entertainers to the city of Huntsville from around the country and giving the local community a wider variety of culture.The goal of the concert series is to offer exceptional talent at an affordable price without forcing residents to leave Huntsville.The organization is ready and eager to hear from the community through comments, questions, constructive criticisms or requests. Concert organizer Andy Slaughter can be contacted via e-mail at [email protected]Both excited and enthusiastic about the upcoming concert, Slaughter said Hest's concert will be only the beginning of many great events in the future.Slaughter said the concert will be good not only for SHSU, but also for the entire community of Huntsville.""He is an exciting talent. Having played across the country should show that he is in high demand,"" Slaughter said. ""The fact that tickets are only $2 means there is no reason why students should not go.""Despite the attention this concert is getting, plenty of people have been working around the clock to organize and plan this event. Slaughter would like to extend several thank you's to several people.""All this would not be possible without the help of Huntsville's Promise, a local non-profit organization. I would like to send a big thank you to all the street-team members for helping me promote this,"" Slaughter said.All tickets for the concert will be sold for $2 each at the door. With such a cheap price, Slaughter and organizers are hopeful a large number of SHSU students will turn out to hear the live music.Organizers promise this will be the best-spent $2 you ever spent.With many people expecting a great turnout, Slaughter said those wanting tickets should arrive at the event early.For more information regarding the Huntsville Concert Series, visit the Web site at www.huntsvilleconcertseries.com."
To be Greek or not to be Greek,Houstonian: Sam Houston State University,"January 1, 1970 Thursday","You have to be the one to decide if rushing a sorority or fraternity, is the right thing for you.Not only do you become Greek after you rush, but you can form a brotherhood or sisterhood with the members that can last a lifetime. Many non-Greek students go through school believing Greeks only party and drink, but that is not always the case.Rushing a fraternity or sorority is like the old saying, ""Don't judge a book by its cover. You never know what you'll get."" The saying is right. Greek life at SHSU is much more than the average person is told. Philanthropies, programs, fundraisers and activities are only a few of the many things that take up a member's busy life.""People who aren't in fraternities are always quick to make accusations,"" said Sigma Phi Epsilon member James Keith. ""No one ever talks about our good grades, achievements and community service."" Students are not the only ones who share misconceptions about fraternities or sororities. ""A professor once told a friend of mine that one of her classes would require a lot of hours, and if the sorority interfered with her work, then she should drop the sorority,"" said Alpha Chi Omega, Assistant Recruitment Chair, Paige McKinzie. They're smart, they excel in their classes, they work diligently with community service and philanthropiesso why are they discriminated against?""We do a lot of good things behind the scenes, we participate in tons of community service,"" said Omega Psi Phi President Quincy King.When it comes to finding the truth behind fraternities and sororities, King says it's best to scratch the surface and look a little deeper. Besides holding its 20th Annual Anniversary Party and an after party for the Brotherhood Sisterhood Conference, Omega Psi Phi also looks forward to working with Fairpark Nursing home, playing dominoes and socializing with patients and working through Achievement Week.Dr. Maryjo Cochran of the Radio and Television Department said she wasn't in a sorority at Southern Methodist University. ""Greek life is huge there, and I didn't have much of a social life and basically turned into academics 24/7,"" Cochran said. ""It wasn't that I wasn't interested, I was quite shy, but I also missed the week of rush every year due to vacationing with my family."" Cochran said if she were to go back through school all over again, she'd definitely give it a try.So while many have false impressions about Greek life on campus, realize the good in what they do and do a little research about the organization. You just might want to join."
Channel 7 offers 26 shows for fall lineup,Houstonian: Sam Houston State University,"January 1, 1970 Thursday","Each fifteen-minute television show is produced as a requirement of advanced directing and production.Many students opted to produce news or talk shows, while others did their shows based on fictional plots. Travis Leamons, senior RTV major, made a suspenseful program entitled ""Snapshot"". ""It's a thriller about two twin sisters. One does a con artist job, and then the other gets a message that she is in trouble and can see what happens,"" Leamons said.Senior RTV major Al Taglialavore said he preferred to do an informational show. ""My show is called 'On the Record' and it's a little bit like 'The List' on MTV, where there are panelists who are given a topic and they discuss it,"" Taglialavore said. ""It's an informational talk show about music. Our last episode was about the best country albums of all time, and the next one is going to be about the best classic rock of all time.""In addition to the new shows, Channel 7 also offers a local newscast consisting of both university and community events. The live news program, which is also produced by students, airs at noon, Monday through Friday and at 6 p.m. and 6:30 p.m. Monday through Thursday. The Sports & Special Events class shoots SHSU sporting events and special occasions such as parades for Channel 7. The monumental October 19 SHSU vs. SFA game and the homecoming football game against McNeese state are a few of many sporting events that will be broadcast on Cable Channel 7 in the next few weeks.Students and faculty said the entire Huntsville community could benefit from watching Channel 7. ""The city of Huntsville should watch Channel 7 because kids are producing these shows for a field they want to get into. It's a stepping stone,"" said Leamons. ""What they do now could be remembered in the future. And the shows get the word out about Huntsville in general. Huntsville is the basis of most of the shows."" Taglialavore agreed, saying that Channel 7 offers programming for everyone. ""It offers such a wide range of different shows,"" Taglialavore said. ""There are all kinds of different tastes, so everything can find something interesting.""The fall schedule of all Cable Channel 7's programming will be available by next week.

Huntsville Police Department to be monitored,Houstonian: Sam Houston State University,"January 1, 1970 Thursday","Mark Pemberton, with the Huntsville Police, said Willis' mother, along with two other members of the community, came into the police station sometime after March 31, obtained complaint forms and had the complaint process explained to them.The March 31 incident was videotaped, as nearly all Huntsville Police Department patrol cars are outfitted with a video camera on the dash, said Pemberton. He said a copy of the video was given to Willis, but ""we haven't heard back since.""The Huntsville Police Department has not heard official word from either the Justice Department or the two civil rights groups about their planned monitoring, said Pemberton on Monday afternoon.Pemberton said he was unaware of how the organizations plan to monitor the department.""I have no concept of that,"" he said. ""We have nothing to hide,"" Pemberton said. ""We will cooperate with any investigation."""
City annexes Gibbs Ranch,Houstonian: Sam Houston State University,"January 1, 1970 Thursday","He also said the annexation only makes the land part of the city of Huntsville, but land ownership does not change hands, although development policies are altered.""Just because we annex it, doesn't mean we own it,"" said Murray. ""But if Sam Houston decides to develop something, it must come up to city code.""Despite such policy changes, Murray said there were no complaints from the school or other landholders about the annexation.""We've had to no negative response from the National Forest, Huntsville State Park, or Sam Houston,"" said Murray.Murray said there would be no new taxes on the lands since it is all government land and therefore tax exempt, and that most people will not notice the difference.A new annexation law is to take effect in January of next year. Murray said the law is one of the ways cities are regulated to keep from just ""gobbling up"" the surrounding communities.According to the new rules, a city must state its desire to annex a community at least three years in advance, and must provide services to bring the infrastructure to code within the three years. If the city does not comply within the three years, the community can de-annex itself and will not be eligible for annexation again for another seven years.Murray said Huntsville mostly desires to annex land that does not require development, because otherwise, the city will pay millions of dollars to bring a community up to city standards that will only contribute a few thousand dollars a year in tax revenues.""It's easier for us to annex land that is not occupied, because you don't have to put in the infrastructure,"" said Murray.Along with the Gibbs Ranch, the city also added a part of the Huntsville Municipal Airport in the Northgate Meadows subdivision, three tracts of U.S. forestland near the Fish Hatchery, one tract of U.S. forestland near Huntsville State Park and another adjacent to Elkins Lake."

Tailgate party promotes spirit,Houstonian: Sam Houston State University,"January 1, 1970 Thursday",
Reggie's Story,Houstonian: Sam Houston State University,"January 1, 1970 Thursday","He began participating and excelled in various sports at a young age. As he looked toward graduation, this honor student was trying to decide which one of the two football scholarship offers he would accept.Looking at Reggie, I saw a face similar to those I see everyday on campus. He looks like the All-American boy, clean-cut hair and sparkling eyes looking out from behind small, metal-rimmed glasses.He was a track star, a football star, a guy whose name the community associated with winning and potential.Reggie was raised by his mother, his father having died young. He defied the statistics of being raised by a single parent and became a success in academics and sports.He was also the stereotypical teenager, getting ready for college and partying with his friends.""Eight months into my senior year, I was out drinking and crossed the yellow line on my way home,"" Reggie said, ""I hit a car full of college students head on.""""Two of those students died instantly, one student was burned over 90 percent of her body. She's still alive today,"" he said.After the accident and out on bond awaiting trial for Intoxication Manslaughter, Reggie received a third scholarship offer, but faced the fact that he probably would not be able to accept it. Two years after the accident, he was sentenced to seven years in prison, with a 10-year probation sentence to run concurrently.""This was the first time I had ever been in trouble,"" Reggie said, ""I had never gotten an MIP, never had a DUI, never even been in trouble at school. Now, I will be either in prison, on parole or on probation until 2011.""Since the accident and realizing the enormity of the mistake he made, Reggie has wanted to do something to give back to the community and help educate young people on the hazards and consequences of drinking and driving.""Any kid anywhere can get their hands on alcohol whenever they want it. There are stores that survive by selling alcohol to minors."" Reggie said.Reggie went on to say that people, college students in particular, don't realize just how dangerous alcohol can be. ""Alcohol is the only legal drug, legal high, that there is out there. It's socially accepted so everyone thinks it's okay,"" he said.""What I want to say to everyone is to be smart about what you're doing. Alcohol is a very powerful substance and easily abused,"" he said.Reggie admitted that he was hoping for probation, which was one option during his sentencing. On probation, he could have paid his restitution, served his time and attended college.Today, Reggie has served 9 months of his seven-year sentence. Since his sentence was considered ""aggravated"" he must serve at least three-fourths of his time before he is eligible for parole.""Most of them (students) think they live in this little bubble of protection where they don't think anything can happen to them,"" Reggie said, ""In one instant, my bubble got popped. It can happen to anyone."""

""She has a great business story about entrepreneurship, perseverance and not giving up on a good idea,"" Vernick said.Debra J. Fields currently consults for Mrs. Fields Cookies, a $450 million company she founded in 1977. She has since sold her company.Fields began her career at the age of 20 without any business experience. She convinced a bank to finance a business concept that did not appear to have a likelihood of success. After all, what business could survive just selling cookies?On Aug. 16, 1977, Mrs. Fields Chocolate Chippery opened to the public in Palo Alto, Calif. The Chippery grew over the next 19 years into over 650 franchise stores around the United States and 10 foreign nations. To extend her vision, Mrs. Fields began franchising in 1990. It is now the most rare of franchise opportunities, according to the Utah State Historical Society. Her mission has always been to create the highest quality product possible, every time. The Historical Society said that commitment has yielded products like no other, deeply satisfying personal indulgences that consumers just can't get enough of. In 1989, she made Mrs. Fields, Inc. the first company in the food retailing business to use technology to control operations and production through a computer program.The program is used at Harvard Business School as an example of successful application of technology in business management.She is the author of the ""Mrs. Fields I Love Chocolate!"" cookbook, ""Debbi Fields' Great American Desserts"" and ""100 Recipes From The Kitchen of Debbi Fields"", which has sold over 1.5 million copies and was the first cookbook to top The New York Times best seller list. Fields gives speeches at seminars for companies throughout the country and serves on the boards of Outback Steakhouse, Inc. in Tampa, Fla., and The Orpheum Theatre and WKNO in Memphis, Tenn. ""The important thing is not being afraid to take a chance. Remember, the greatest failure is to not try. Once you find something you love to do, be the best at doing it,"" said Fields, in Career World Magazine.Breakfast with Mrs. Fields will be at 9 a.m. in Austin Hall. The leaders of student organizations on campus should contact Maggie Babcock, special events coordinator for the Office of the President, for more information.

The speech is open to the university and surrounding community.Babcock said the capacity for the auditorium is 444 and the lecture will be broadcast in overflow rooms if the auditorium is filled. The overflow rooms are the Stretcher room and the Bates room.Orange Keys will distribute programs and direct people on where to go. A luncheon for community leaders will follow the lecture, Babcock said. The President's Speaker Series, underwritten by Lu Ellen Gibbs of Huntsville, was established to bring prominent leaders to the SHSU campus. This forum gives students an opportunity to learn and grow from people who are living successful and principled lives. The Series hosts one public event each semester.

Students participate in panel discussion,Houstonian: Sam Houston State University,"January 1, 1970 Thursday","""The discussion was informative and enlightening. Everyone who spoke had legitimate reasons to support his or her viewpoint,"" Moore said. ""It was nice to hear the other side.""The ""No More War, No More Hate"" event was coordinated by Assistant English Professor Dr. Shane Graham, who wanted to present a discussion among the SHSU community on why we should look to other options besides war. In addition to Graham, members of the faculty panel included Dr. Christie Fox Visting Assistant Professor of English, Dr. Bernadette Pruitt Assistant Professor of History and Dr. Nicholas Pappas Associate Professor of History. Members of the Muslim community were also involved including leader of the Muslim Student Association Adhallah-MuhhammdBey. With the anti-war theme being at the top of discussion other aspects were not slighted. Dr. Pruitt spoke on the controversial topic of African-Americans and patriotismAlthough she acknowledged historical events in the country that may sway African-American's views, overall "" African American are in fact patriotic,"" she said. Pruitt explained the patriotic split of the Black race with many having a deep love for this country which is evident through military enrollment and others harboring unpleasant feelings.In response to interested students who wanted insight into minorities' feelings regarding to 11th, Pruitt said there was no easy answer. Dr. Cheryl Anisman Associate Professor of the Psychology department, told audience members she was on the verge of offering her expertise in pyscology to the F.BI. when she began to suffer discrimination at American airports due to her Muslim faith and Jewish last name. Anisman said those experiences of being repeatedly delayed, searched and frisked gave her mixed feelings regarding the government. She has not offered her services to the FBI. The pro-war position was not absent with heated comments coming from Dr. Keith Hendrickson of the History department and several students who agree that war is the most productive answer. Panel members agreed the media has given the public all of the reasons in support of going to war while not looking at any other alternatives. ""(Dr.) Christie Fox and I organized the panel with lots of help from students and collegues."" Graham said. ""We started it because we were frustrated.""Fox learned of the tragedy from a neighbor around 9 a.m. on the eleventh and said she did not believe him at first. When she turned on the television she watched the news coverage ""until I had class at two,"" she said. Fox said that her inspiration to start the panel discussion was due to her fear that she would be ashamed America's reaction.Fox said she does want Bin-Laden brought to justice, although she does not have a concrete non-violent suggestion at this time. What she is sure about is her opposition to the killing of innocent people in an effort to catch him.Although the panel was composed of anti-war spokesmen, Graham said finding those people was the hardest part. ""A lot of people told us that they share our reservation about the war, but I think they're afraid to take part because they might be branded ""unpatriotic.""Graham said the intention of the discussion was not to change anyone's mind. All we can do is give them food for thought,"" he said. Junior Natalie Thomas said she has a neutral stance regarding the war efforts but appreciated the opportunity to hear both sides of the issue.Graham said he and Fox have discussed starting an on going lecture series in order to explore certain topics in-depth. "" Whether we pursue it would depend on the response of the student body."" Thomas said she would actively participate in additional events and forums regarding these issues. ""Yes, I would definitely attend,"" she said."
Hector's Story,Houstonian: Sam Houston State University,"January 1, 1970 Thursday","The fast money available became enticing as he began to involve himself with not only the use, but also the sale and transport of these drugs.""The first time I got in trouble, I was transporting marijuana across the checkpoint,"" Hector said, ""I didn't think it would be a big deal, and it wasn't. I received one year probation, which I never completed.""Hector said he figured nothing would really happen to him if he was just on probation, so he didn't follow the guidelines set by the court, and continued his involvement with the drug trade. Although Hector had a job, he soon found it hard to support his habit financially.""I started breaking into houses to feed my addiction,"" Hector said, ""I wanted to live good, party all the time and have money on the side.""""I soon lost control of my life. My addiction got the better of me. I was kicked out of my house,"" Hector said.Hector started the night of his 20th birthday partying. ""I was coming off a lot of drugs, and I ended up jacking somebody for their car,"" he said. This birthday bash earned Hector a nine-year prison sentence for Aggravated Robbery. At age 24, Hector has now served three and one-half years of his sentence. Since his sentence was aggravated, he must serve at least three-fourths of his sentence before becoming eligible for parole.""The hardest thing about prison is being away from my family, that's what has brought me to tears at times,"" Hector said. ""After looking over my life, I found out I didn't want to live that way anymore. The best I can do to redeem myself to the people I've hurt is to make sure I don't do that again.""Hector is one of several Texas inmates involved in Operation Kick-It, a community education program run by TDCJ-ID designed to educate young people on the consequences of using drugs and alcohol. He said he feels the program gives him the opportunity to give back to the community, and hopes his story will let people know that things like prison can happen to anyone.Another point that Hector emphasizes is the diversity in the Texas prison population. ""Anyone can come to prison, it doesn't discriminate,"" he said.Hector has taken advantage of some educational opportunities while in prison, and hopes to finish his education upon release. One day he hopes to own a business, or teach, but for now, he keeps what he feels is a realistic outlook. ""My major is Psychology, but I've learned a trade too, the automotive trade. It's something I can do when I first get out, at least there, the doors aren't all the way closed.""Wanting to be part of the crowd is just one factor that led to Hector's problems. He made bad decisions and chose to go along with what everyone else was doing, rather than setting positive goals and going against the grain of the world in which he was raised. ""There's a lot of kids out there, I was one of them, that are just stubborn. It took coming to prison to snap me out of it, he said, ""Hopefully, this will make them at least think twice.""""Don't be afraid to be yourself. All these kids have this word 'cool' they're trying to live up to. Your individuality is what makes you cool,"" Hector said."
"""8 Mile"" movie review",Houstonian: Sam Houston State University,"January 1, 1970 Thursday","The movie starts off slow. You first find yourself wondering what is going on because the characters are not saying much, but as the movie progresses Eminem's character, Bunny Rabbit, becomes more open and lets his personality shine as he struggles with stage fright. Bunny Rabbit is forced to endure several hardships throughout the movie that seem rather depressing, but help set the mood for the whole movie. It seems as though B. Rabbit cannot get a break, even though his friends are relentlessly trying to help him. I find this situation annoying because no matter how much encouragement they seem to give him, he cannot bring himself to perform to his potential.The plot then starts to intensify as the character realizes what he has to do in order to succeed in one of his ""battles"" and blows the competition away with exciting rhymes and raps. The film becomes entertaining and you find yourself singing along with the characters, but just as soon as the movie became good, the movie stops. I was left wanting more and the audience felt the same. Although it seems Eminem is confident in front of the camera, the supporting cast carries him through the movie. The director did an excellent job of presenting the audience with the different characters and the setting in the movie. Good story, good movie, but a bad ending."

International student enrollment increases,Houstonian: Sam Houston State University,"January 1, 1970 Thursday","Shetty said he appreciates the school for the various opportunities it provides, as well as its location and climate.""Now I feel very lucky that I am in Sam Houston State University, primarily because of the good computer science program and also the on-campus jobs available, and the weather here also suits most of the Indian students coming here,"" Shetty said.Laura Guy, a student from Canada, came to SHSU to pursue a doctoral in psychology.""I chose to move here from Montral, Canada, specifically to attend the forensic clinical psychology Ph.D. program at SHSU,"" said Guy. ""There are not many universities that offer this type of program, so it was a special opportunity.""Guy has been attending the university for four years, and plans to stay for the remaining two.""Since moving here, I have been impressed with the quality of the program, including the training and education that I have received thus far,"" she said.Guy also said that she has adjusted to living in a smaller community and that she advocates the university for other foreign students in her field.""Although transplanting myself to a smaller community such as Huntsville has taken a little bit of time to get used to, I definitely would recommend Sam to other students interested in what I am studying,"" said Guy.A second year international student, graduate student Ruohui Zhao of China is seeking a master's in criminal justice.""My main reason that I choose Sam Houston State University to continue my graduate study is that it has one of the best criminal justice programs in the world,"" said Zhao.Along with the master's program, Zhao also enjoys the school environment and activities it offers.""During one and half years' study in SHSU, I find that the environment here is very beautiful and peaceful, which benefits my study,"" said Zhao.

""I really love being here, not only because I became friends with really great people, but also because people are very hospitable and friendly here in general.""Apart from the attitudes of her fellow students on campus, she also enjoys the attention students can receive from their professors.""I really like the teacher-student ratio,"" said Bengel. ""It's small enough to give the student individual attention.""Along with more degree programs, the university has also increased the services it offers to international students, which Boeske also cites as a reason for increased international interest in the university.""The growth of the Office of International Programs has improved services offered to international students, regarding academic advisement as well as student services,"" said Boeske.Boeske credits two of the university vice presidents with helping her office's growth.""Academic Affairs under Dr. Payne and Student Services under Dr. (Thelma) Douglass have made OIP's growth possible,"" said Boeske."
Campus police work on crime prevention,Houstonian: Sam Houston State University,"January 1, 1970 Thursday","The increase in crimes could be a result of more reporting, not necessarily more crime occurring, Police Lt. Gary Crain said.There were nine forcible sex offenses in 2002, compared to five in 2001, according to university crime statistics released this month. Seven of the sex offenses were rapes and five of the seven involved acquaintances and alcohol, Crain said.The university probably follows the national trend of underreporting sex offenses, Crain said. Also, some crimes may not be reported until the next year because the victim doesn't come forward immediately.""We would like to have the reports right away, so we can investigate them,"" Crain said. ""We hope there is more reporting and continue our education and prevention programs.""Crain said his department's crime-prevention officer has stayed busy since school started with requests for presentations.""All we can do is keep trying to educate the campus community about thefts, personal safety and drinking,"" Crain said.Arrests for public intoxication rose slightly, with 82 in 2002, compared to 79 in 2001 and 62 in 2000, according to police statistics, while drug-related arrests dropped from 28 in 2001 to 13 last year.Crain said that, many times, students won't tolerate drug use in residence halls or elsewhere on campus and turn in the violators. Police don't patrol residence halls, so they rely on hall officials who receive prevention training, or on residents.Some prevention programs may have had an impact, as the number of burglaries and thefts fell last year, Crain said. Reported burglaries went from 43 in 2001 to 21 in 2002, and thefts also slightly dropped.""We keep telling students to lock their doors if they go down to the shower or to another room,"" Crain said. ""Most of the burglaries are crimes of opportunity. We are hoping that people are listening."""
"""The Magic Flute"" was simply astounding",Houstonian: Sam Houston State University,"January 1, 1970 Thursday","I particularly liked Professor Andrew Wilson and Erin Daniel's performances on the violin. Sohi Yi played a very intricate viola. I also enjoyed the combination of David Scott's bass with Mike Ross's cello. The entire orchestra performed well under the conduction of Dr. William Reber.The opera was well played by the actors and singers. Chad Miller sang wonderfully as Tamino, as did his partner Papageno, playfully done by Patrick Newcomb. The best singing performance of the night was done by the Queen of the Night, Alison Lund, whose voice was crystal and pristine.There was not a lacking voice in the entire production. All of the actors and singers worked well together and nothing was out of place in the performance. Dr. Dorothy Madison and Professor Christopher Michel did well in directing the stage performances. I was particularly amused and entertained with the monster in the production with the quasi-Chinese dragon allusion. I would also like to give a special commendation to Edmund Mercado, who pulled double duty as the nasty slave Monastatos and one of the Priests.I particularly enjoyed the performance of Ilyana Mansfiled, who played one of the animals in the children's chorus. The children performers did very well.What I liked most about this production is that I was never bored. Everything about this performance held my attention. It completely violated the old clich that opera can substitute for a sleeping pill.The many organizations that came together to make this production did a great job. I hope to see more operas like this done in the future and I will make sure to see the next production."

Tales from the trail,Houstonian: Sam Houston State University,"January 1, 1970 Thursday","As a matter of fact, by the time this goes to print I will be standing at the top of Springer Mountain Georgia, 3,782 feet up, ready to step on the Appalachian Trail.Over the course of the next several weeks, I hope you'll take the time and come along as I explore the trail that begins in Georgia and ends in the remote wilderness of Maine.First, let's discuss some history of the trail. We need to dispel the notion that the trail, like that of Lewis and Clark, is one of the great trails in history. It is not. The truth is that the trail was the vision of a little known government regional planner named Benton Mackaye.It was 1921 when Mackaye envisioned a series of trails connecting self-sufficient community camps that could be used by city dwellers to reconnect with nature.

Voters check 'yes' to amend Texas constitution,Houstonian: Sam Houston State University,"January 1, 1970 Thursday","But in the northern Collin County town of Anna, sale of all alcoholic beverages was rejected, with 47 percent of 813 registered voters going to the polls. Citizens for More Shopping and Less Taxes spent the summer collecting petitions to put beer and wine sales on the ballot. Group members said approval would bring the city much-needed sales-tax revenue. Collin County has no liquor stores, although beer and wine are sold in Frisco, Melissa and parts of Plano. ""It's pretty discouraging,"" Dan Lovitt, who initiated the Anna petition drive, said late Saturday. ""I worked hard and did what I could."" The laid-off telecommunications worker, who went door-to-door collecting signatures, said he had planned to open a liquor store. But Anna resident Jim Jake Templin said, ""I think people decided that Anna needed to be a family-friendly community."" For the Spring ISD in north Harris County, voters approved three propositions totaling $257 million to be used for new schools, renovations and equipment purchases. Most of the package, $210 million, will fund construction of four elementary schools, one middle school and one high school.Voters in the Allen Independent School District approved $71.5 million in bonds to pay for two new elementary schools, expansion of Allen High School and technological upgrades. About 13,800 students were enrolled in Allen schools this year, a 10 percent increase from last year, and educators said the bond package was needed to accommodate the growing population. In Argyle, voters approved two quarter-cent sales taxes that will fund a crime-control and prevention district and pay for street repair and maintenance. City Administrator Mike Webb said higher voter turnout than the last sales-tax election, in May 2002, resulted from the state constitutional amendments, even though voters had to go to two different polling places and cast two different ballots."
Suspect No.1,Global Times (China),"January 1, 1970 Thursday","The lab-leak theory, that COVID-19 was leaked from a laboratory, has once again caused a clamor since the beginning of this year, months after the argument was thrown into the trash can of conspiracy theories by an overwhelming number of scientists. 

Observers found that things only get more complicated when the origins of the coronavirus - an already difficult scientific issue - is entangled in political manipulation tricks. Combing through more than 8,000 pieces of news reports related to the lab-leak theory, the Global Times found that as many as 60 percent of the coverage was from the US alone. 

It is worth noting that many media outlets in the US-led Western world, which hyped the lab-leak theory, are only willing to focus on the Chinese labs though they have been thoroughly investigated by the World Health Organization (WHO), while turning a blind eye to the more suspicious American biological research institutions, such as the infamous US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) at Fort Detrick, Maryland.The USAMRIID was temporarily shut down in 2019 after a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) inspection. Although this mysterious lab reported the reason for the closure as ""ongoing infrastructure issues with wastewater decontamination,"" the explanation was not persuasive enough. The Global Times found that the lab's failure to control toxins seemed to have alarmed the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction related institutions in the US.

Resurgence of lab-leak theory

A joint study into the origins of COVID-19 by Chinese experts and the WHO in March dismissed the ""lab-leak"" conspiracy theory. More evidence pointed to the fact that the virus had probably jumped from bats to humans via another intermediary animal, and it was ""extremely unlikely"" that it leaked from a lab, the study report said.

Nonetheless, the lab-leak theory has not disappeared; instead, especially from the beginning of May, it has been largely promoted by some US politicians and media outlets as a ""plausible science."" In an article published on Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists on May 5, without any evidence, science writer Nicholas Wade claimed that ""proponents of lab escape can explain all the available facts about SARS2 considerably more easily than can those who favor natural emergence.""

Days later, The Wall Street Journal reported on May 23 that three researchers at Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) ""became sick enough in November 2019 that they sought hospital care,"" and they had ""symptoms consistent with both Covid-19 and common seasonal illness."" The WSJ report quoted a ""previously undisclosed US intelligence report.""

On May 26, President Biden stated that he had ordered the US intelligence community to ""redouble"" its efforts to investigate the origins of COVID-19. The US national security adviser Jake Sullivan even claimed on June 20 that China will face ""isolation in the international community"" if it doesn't cooperate with a further probe into the origin of the COVID-19 pandemic, Bloomberg reported that day.Research personnel work inside the bio-level 4 lab at the USAMRIID at Fort Detrick on September 26, 2002. Photo: AFPPressure from politicians and the media seems to have affected some authoritative medical scientists in the US, including Director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), Anthony Fauci. On May 11, after Rand Paul, a Republican to the Senate, accused Fauci of helping the Wuhan lab ""create"" the virus, Fauci strongly denied the accusation but said he is ""fully in favor of any further investigation of what went on in China.""

This sudden change in attitude of some US experts is due to the political pressure they have received, a Chinese virologist told the Global Times. ""Western media like to ask the experts misguiding questions, like, 'is (lab leak) absolutely impossible?'"" said the virologist who requested anonymity.

It's very difficult for experts to answer a question like that, as the possibility, although very little, still exists, the virologist said. ""All they can say is, 'it's possible,'"" he told the Global Times. Actually, most experts usually add ""but it's highly unlikely"" after ""it's possible,"" but the media only presents the part which confirms their own bias, he said.

Big data shows the US is pushing the narrative of the COVID-19 lab-leak theory. Among the 8,594 pieces of news report related to ""lab leak"" that database GDELT collected since 2020, 5,079 were from the US, accounting for 59 percent. Following the US was the UK (611 pieces) and Australia (597 pieces). Almost all the coverage targeted the WIV lab.

While the US is solely focused on Chinese labs, the US seldom pays attention to the fault in its own domestic labs, some of which have even triggered virus-related accidents before. According to an August 2020 article by ProPublica, an independent newsroom that produces investigative journalism, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill reported 28 lab incidents involving genetically engineered organisms to safety officials at the National Institutes of Health between January 2015 and June 2020. ""Six of the incidents involved various types of lab-created coronaviruses,"" ProPublica said in the article. ""Many were engineered to allow the study of the virus in mice.""

Weirdly, very few US mainstream media outlets have raised the question whether there is the possibility that COVID-19 was leaked from US labs, said the Chinese virologist. ""They dare not ask that,"" he said.

In an article published on the independent political blog site Moon of Alabama on May 27, the author pointed out that some Westerners' hyping of the Wuhan lab leak conspiracy is similar to the trick the US played in pushing the Iraq War in 2002 - the US claimed ""Saddam Hussein will soon have nuclear weapon,"" which was ""obvious nonsense,"" the author said.

""The 'lab leak' theory is similar to the WMD claim - evidence-free speculation long promoted by a neoconservative leaning administration that was extremely hostile to the 'guilty' country in question,"" said the author.

The lab-leak theory, therefore, ""isn't just about an implausible, evidence free tale of a SARS-CoV-2 lab escape,"" the author noted. ""It is a campaign launched to depict China as an enemy of humankind.""

Intl concerns on US bio-labs 

The US has many bio-labs in 25 countries and regions across the Middle East, Africa, Southeast Asia and the former Soviet Union states, with 16 in Ukraine alone. Some of these labs have seen large-scale outbreaks of measles and other dangerous infectious diseases, according to media reports. Outside view of the bio-level 3 and 4 lab at the USAMRIID at Fort Detrick on September 26, 2002. Photo: AFPThe international community has frequently expressed concern over US' biological militarization activities in other countries. 

In October 2020, Deputy Chairman of the Security Council of Russia, Dmitry Medvedev, said that the US research activities in bio-labs in members of the Commonwealth of the Independent States have caused grave concern. The US not only builds bio-labs in these countries, but also tries to do so in other places across the world. However, its research lacks transparency and runs counter to the rules of the international community and international organizations.

Anatoly Tsyganok, a corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Military Sciences and associate professor of Faculty of World Politics at Lomonosov Moscow State University, told the Global Times that biological and bacteriological weapons tests on US territory are prohibited by the US Congress. He said that the US military has been and is still carrying out tests of biological and bacteriological weapons in Georgia. 

This is done under the guise of providing sick people with various therapeutic vaccines conducted by the US military and American private contractors at the Richard Lugar Center for Public Health Research, Tsyganok said. Related tests have been exposed by various media outlets. 

In December 2015, 30 patients at the research center who were being treated for hepatitis C died. Twenty-four of them died on the same day, and their cause of death was listed as ""unknown,"" according to Tsyganok and Russia news outlet. 

Residents of neighborhoods around these labs often complain about health problems. 

Bulgarian journalist Dilyana Gaytandzhieva published a story about the Lugar center in early 2018. In her interviews for the report, most residents who lived nearby the labs complained of headaches, nausea and high blood pressure. They also said there was black smoke coming from the lab.

USA Today reported that since 2003, hundreds of incidents involving accidental contact with deadly pathogens occurred in US bio-labs at home and abroad. This may cause the direct contacts to be infected, who can then spread the virus to communities and start an epidemic.

A member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Armais Kamalov said in an interview with TASS in early June that development of genetically-engineered viruses as biological weapons should be subject to the same worldwide ban as the testing of nuclear weapons. He mentioned US labs in Georgia and Armenia as reference.

""There are a lot of labs, which are bankrolled today by the United States Department of Defense. It's no secret that they are in Georgia, Armenia and other republics. It's surprising that access to such labs is off-limits, and we don't understand what they are doing there,"" he said. 

What had happened in July 2019?  

The terrible safety records of American biological labs around the world shows a possibility of a virus escaping from an American lab. Many point to the shutdown of Fort Detrick lab in July 2019. 

In July 2019, six months before the US reported its first COVID-19 case, Army laboratory at Fort Detrick that studies deadly infectious material like Ebola and smallpox was shut down after the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a cease-and-desist order. CDC officials refused to release further information after citing ""national security reasons.""

The USAMRIID in Fort Detrick said in August 2019 that the shutdown was because the center did not have ""sufficient systems in place to decontaminate wastewater"" from its highest-security labs, the New York Times reported. 

What exactly happened at Fort Detrick in the summer of 2019? Some US media previously turned to CDC to get answers, but many key contents in the report had been redacted. 

In early June, a Virginia-based Twitter user got the CDC documents on the inspection of the Fort Detrick under The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Global Times found that most of the documents were emails between CDC officials at various departments and USAMRIID from 2018 to 2019. Although some of the emails were covered by an ABC-affiliated television station in Washington, the report did not catch much attention. 

The emails revealed several violations at the Fort Detrick lab during CDC's inspections in 2019. Four of which were labeled serious violations. 

One of these serious violations, the CDC said, was one inspector who entered a room multiple times without the required respiratory protection while other people in that room were performing procedures with a non-human primate on a necropsy table.

This deviation from entity procedures resulted in a respiratory occupational exposure to select agent aerosols, the CDC said. 

In another serious violation, the CDC said the USAMRIID had ""systematically failed to ensure implementation of biosafety and containment procedures commensurate with the risks associated with working with select agents and toxins.""

Other violations included lack of proper waste management where waste wasn't transported in a durable leak proof container, which creates the potential for spills or leaks. 

The CDC documents show that it sent a letter of concern to USAMRIID, which resulted in a temporary shutdown of the Fort Detrick lab in 2019.

In an email on July 12, 2019, the CDC said the USAMRIID reported two breaches of containment on July 1 and July 11, 2019, and this demonstrated a ""failure of USAMRIID to implement and maintain containment procedures sufficient to contain select agents or toxin generated by BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratory operations."" 

""Effective immediately, USAMRIID must cease all work involving select agents and toxins in registered laboratory areas until the root cause investigation has been conducted for each incident and the results have been submitted to FSAP for review,"" the CDC said.

The FSAP (Federal Select Agent Program) is jointly comprised of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Division of Select Agents and Toxins and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service's Division of Agricultural Select Agents and Toxins. The program oversees the possession, use and transfer of biological select agents and toxins, which have the potential to cause a severe threat to the public, animal or plant health or to animal or plant products. Common examples of select agents and toxins include the organisms that cause anthrax, smallpox, and the bubonic plague.

Three days later, the Fort Detrick replied the email by saying that it had submitted messages in response to the immediate action, but the messages were deliberately blotted out.

The message was submitted by a director for Strategic Studies (Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction) at the USAMRIID whose name was also blotted out.

The Fort Detrick's public statement released in August 2019 said the shutdown was due to problems in decontaminating wastewater. But it's not clear whether the statement was consistent with CDC's inspection results.



The management of such high-level labs in general must be very strict with regular inspections. Various systems should be able to ensure that no potential risks can occur, and equipment failure and wastewater leakage certainly should not occur, a Chinese scientist from the WHO-China virus origins tracing team who requested anonymity told the Global Times.

The wastewater problems revealed major loopholes in the management at the Fort Detrick lab, and one has to wonder what else was leaked with the mismanaged wastewater.

Thanks for it all,Houstonian: Sam Houston State University,"January 1, 1970 Thursday","For starters, I want to thank the Sam Houston State and Huntsville communities for coming and supporting the Kats in their win against the Lumberjacks.On the first Friday of the break students, faculty, staff and the community packed Johnson Coliseum. For the two games the Bearkats hosted, a combined total of nearly 10,000 people showed to cheer on their team.After the SFA newspaper, The Pine Log, called SHSU out for not supporting the Kats in the previous showdown, the Bearkat faithful showed the 'Jacks what school spirit is all about.By the way, SFA had a whopping 2,496 in attendance when they played Southwest Texas in the semifinals. I guess the biggest game of the year wasn't important enough for Lumberjack fans to fill their Coliseum.I would also like to thank the Bearkat band for their presence during the season. The games all season long had a different feel from last year when you could hear a pin drop in Johnson Coliseum. Late in the season, when the stands were packed, the band added excitement to the game, giving it a ""big school"" atmosphere.When I heard the news that the Kats were going to Tampa, I was pumped about heading to Florida for a part of my vacation. Once the dust of my plans to get there settled, myself, Cody Stark, Matthew Normand and athletic trainer Brian Parker loaded into Cody's truck for the 1,000-mile journey. The drive was worth it because we were going to see our school play in its first ever NCAA tournament game. Sixteen hours in a truck can do a job on your body, but when we pulled into Tampa we knew the pain was worth it because we were there to support our team.On Friday night the Florida Gators, who were only two hours from their home in Gainesville, showed the Bearkats why they were ranked No. 1 in the country earlier in the season. The three-point display the Gators put on in the second half was a sight to see. As a basketball fan I was amazed at the hot shooting; as a Bearkat fan I was depressed to see our team lose.The reason for the trip was of course to ""work"". I was an impartial journalist from Huntsville and I was ""working"". Let's be serious - I had to try my hardest to stop from cheering from my seat on press row directly behind the Florida bench. I probably didn't do the best job in the world, but I don't regret it at all.Despite the outcome of Friday night's game, I left the St. Pete Times Forum with my head held high. I felt good knowing the reason I was even in Tampa was because our team was the best of the best in the Southland Conference and we beat SFA to make it to the Big Dance.All in all, this Spring Break was one of the best I've ever had. The Thursday before our week away from school I had no plans and I ended up driving over 2,000 miles and getting to go see the NCAA Tournament.As a Bearkat basketball fan, I want to thank the team for giving me the opportunity to travel and give them congratulations on a great season."

Whoa dude... the 80's are back,Houstonian: Sam Houston State University,"January 1, 1970 Thursday","Although The Point has a solid 18-34 year-old following, the average listener is in their mid-20s to mid-30s. ""Most listeners are starting families, holding jobs, or are recent graduates of college. The music is sort of like a yearbook on the airways, said Walters. Everyone seems to think the '80s were their decade, whether they were in grade school or high school back then,"" she said. 106.9 primarily plays rock, alternative and new wave music.""The '80s were definitely the only decade that could get away with the lyrics it did,"" said Walters. ""Remember Corey Hart singing 'Don't Switch a Blade on a Guy in Shades?' Why is that? ""Are the shades going to stop that blade? Is he just too cool to be stabbed? I think about that every time we play that song,"" she said. Deloreis Douglas, a math major at North Harris Community College, said she is a big fan of '80s music. ""That's when music was music, you understood what they (artists) were saying,"" she said. Douglas listens to The Point while working in Houston.Music isn't the only entertainment medium diving into the pool of '80s popularity.

Although the movie was shot in the '80s, the anniversary showing will have a small millennium flavor. According to E.T.'s official Web site, dialogue in the original movie included the word terrorist, which will now be changed to hippie.So why are the '80s so popular? The '80s was a fun, redefined decade. There was nothing like it before, and nothing has been the same since. It was just a flamboyant time of life.

Christians celebrate Christ's resurrection,Houstonian: Sam Houston State University,"January 1, 1970 Thursday","On Easter Sunday, Christians commemorate the fact that Jesus Christ rose from the grave on the third day after his crucifixion and death on Calvary.People who were very aware of seasonal change and arranged their lives and community events around them, founded the ancient traditions of Easter. The festivities of Easter have many customs and legends that are pagan in origin and have nothing to do with Christianity.The name Easter comes from Eastre, ancient goddess of mythology who signified spring and fertility. In pagan times an annual spring festival was held in her honor. It was not until the second century that Easter became known as a religious holiday.During the second century, missionaries attempted to convert Saxons to Christianity. To coincide with their spring festival, Eastre, missionaries incorporated the Christian message with the pagan traditions. Slowly the people were converted and the festival was changed into the Christian celebration called Easter.Some Easter customs have come from this and other pre-Christian spring festivals. Others come from the Passover feast of the Jews, observed in memory of their deliverance from Egypt.Of all the symbols associated with Easter, the Easter egg is the most identifiable. The egg was originally a symbol of fertility and new life. Eggs were painted with bright colors to represent the sunlight of spring and were used in contests and given as gifts. Children today still enjoy coloring and hunting for eggs on Easter morning.The Easter bunny has its origins in pre-Christian festivals as well. The rabbit, the earthly symbol of Eastre, was known as the most fertile animal and served as a symbol of new life during the spring.German settlers introduced the Easter bunny to America during the 1700s. Children believed that if they were good, they would be brought a nest of colored eggs. The German tradition was ignored until after the Civil War when Easter became more widely celebrated in the United States.Lilies are also synonymous with Easter. The lily, unlike the bunnies and eggs, does have Christian meaning. This white flower represents the purity that came through the resurrection of Jesus Christ.The shape of the lily is also significant. Its bell-shape is like that of a trumpet and represents the announcing of victory.Another Christian symbol associated with Easter is the cross. The cross is the holiest of Christian symbols. It represents the cross Jesus Christ was crucified on so the sins of humanity could be redeemed.According to Joseph Magee, director of the Catholic Student Center on campus, the cross and lilies are not the only Christian symbols of Easter.""Easter is the celebration of the resurrection of Christ, so the empty tomb is an important symbol of that event,"" he said.Though the Christian meaning and traditions of Easter are often lost in the commercialization of the holiday, it is important that people spend the day with loved ones celebrating hope, love and new beginnings."
Ramadan at Sam,Houstonian: Sam Houston State University,"January 1, 1970 Thursday","27, Muslims abstain from food, drink, smoking and sexual activity. It is a time for inner reflection, devotion to God and self-control.""It's purpose is to refrain us from worldly activities, Abdallah Muhammad-Bey, said president of Sam Houston's Muslim Student Association.Ramadan is also a time of intensive worship, giving to charities, purifying one's behavior and doing good deeds. It is also a chance to read the Quran, which is a record of the words revealed by God through the angel Gabriel to the prophet Muhammad.As a secondary goal, fasting is a way of experiencing hunger and developing sympathy for the less fortunate. The daily period of fasting starts at the break of dawn and ends at the setting of the sun.The usual practice is to have a meal before dawn and after sunset.The intention to fast may be made during the night before going to sleep or it can be made at the time of Suhoor before dawn. Suhoor is eating before fasting.""At the end of the day we break the fast,"" Muhammad-Bey said. ""We eat something light such as fruit and juice.""It is desirable to break the fast as soon as possible after sunset.After sunset when they have prayed, they are then allowed to eat dinner. It includes rice, vegetables, lamb or goat meat, water or juice, Muhammad-Bey said.""We can't eat a lot of meat,"" he said.Although all Muslims are expected to fast during Ramadan, there are some exceptions.Children who are younger than age 11, women who are on their menstrual cycles or pregnant, Muslims who are traveling, insane, and the elderly are not permitted to fast.They are required to feed at least one poor person per day in Ramadan for every missed fasting. If Muslims invalidate their fast, they are required to make up missed days or be penalized.They will have to make up fasting days if they ate or drank intentionally, caused themselves to vomit or intended to break the fast before sunset.The penalty for sexual intercourse during fasting is to fast an additional 60 continuous days. If one is not able to do so, he or she must feed 60 poor people an average of one meal.Muslims are permitted to break the fast of Ramadan is there is danger to their health. In this case, a Muslim should make up his fast later any time in the year.The last 10 days of the Ramadan are known as the Holiest Days. It is a time when everyone tries to become closer with God. Mahammad-Bey said Muslims usually spend the last 10 days of the fast locked in the majid, the place of worship. A Muslim can choose either to stay a few days in the majid, or the entire 10 days, Muhammad-Bey said.""You get blessed more if you stay the whole 10 days,"" he said."
Prof profiles: Bernadette Pruitt,Houstonian: Sam Houston State University,"January 1, 1970 Thursday","Pruitt has been at SHSU since spring 1996. In addition to teaching United States History and an independent study class on the Civil Rights Movement, she is currently working on a book based on her dissertation.Pruitt earned her bachelor and master's degrees at Texas Southern University and completed her doctorate in May 2001 at University of Houston. She is the first African-American women to earn a doctorate in history at the University of Houston.She said she had an interest in history at a very young age.""I remember as a little girl listening to my grandmother talk about her childhood and young adult life during the Great Depression,"" Pruitt said. ""I was fascinated and intrigued.""Students said her fascination and passion for history is shown in her teaching style in the classroom.""It's easy to pay attention and learn because she brings the class into her discussions,"" sophomore Daniel Reeves said. ""She is exciting in the classroom.""""I love teaching because I love students,"" Pruitt said.Pruitt said her goal is to ""remind students of the important and essential value history teaches.""She said she believes it is imperative for everyone to know about the history of his or her ancestry.""U.S. History is amazing, passionate, exciting and sometimes frustrating,"" Pruitt said. ""My responsibility as a historian is to encourage students who have an interest in history to go into history as a profession.""Pruitt's areas of specialization include African-American history since 1865, internal migration, race relations and ethnicity and African-American studies.""I love teaching African-American history, even with the intensity and controversy it can bring,"" she said.Pruitt teaches a course in African-American history during the fall semester.Her dissertation, ""For the Advancement of the Race: African-American Migration and Community Building in Houston, 1914-1945"", examined the movement of black people into Texas' largest metropolitan center from surrounding farms and small towns in eastern Texas and Louisiana.""Most people think that the Great Migration was the movement of African-Americans out of the south,"" Pruitt said. ""My work shows that large numbers of African-Americans stayed in the south and moved into cities like Houston.""I am working on getting articles published for my book that will be based on my dissertation.""Pruitt anticipates that her Houston area research will be complete this summer. The following summer she plans conduct research at the National Archives, looking into the Department of Labor and the Department of Housing and Development records relating to the time period around World War II.Pruitt's project is the first scholarly attempt since the Civil Rights Movement to address the significance of the Great Migration in Texas.Pruitt is a past recipient of the University of Houston African-American Studies Graduate Fellowship, Organization of American Historians Huggins-Quarles Award, Who's Who Among American Teachers and Who's Who Among American Women, to name a few.In addition to her teaching and on-going research, she is scheduled to speak at the Texas State Historical Meeting, and is participating in a workshop at University of Houston next month."
Ghost tales of Sam Houston State University,Houstonian: Sam Houston State University,"January 1, 1970 Thursday","As a freshman, living in Belvin was beyond weird. It was crazy and when she heard these ghostly tales, she didn't think twice that they weren't true.""The first story I ever heard was a girl shooting herself in a community bathroom on the ground floor of Belvin/Buchanan Hall. You're supposed to see the silhouette of her face on the wall,"" Blackmon said. ""Supposedly, that's why there is a wall covering up the two bathrooms,"" she said.While Blackmon ponders back and forth what is true and what is not, besides the rumors, there could be evidence to support the bathroom incident.""On the fire emergency exit map on the back of everyone's dorm room door, the maps on the ground floor show two bathrooms. If it's not true, then why are they on the map?"" she asked.JoEllen Tipton, director of Residence Life, begs to differ. ""There has been no such thing like someone shooting themselves, or someone murdering somebody. UPD hasn't ever reported anything of that matter. There has been stories, but even then, in Belvin, there has never been bathrooms on the ground floor. The room on the ground floor that people mistake the bathroom for being, is a maintenance closet that holds air conditioning equipment,"" she said.""We've heard the girl's face on the wall story, but none of the staff or faculty has ever seen it. In the late 70s, a lot of girls painted murals on the walls of the ground floor, which is also known as the garden floor. Depending on the paint color on the walls, in between the years, I'm guessing that some of the pictures might still show through the repainting renovations,"" Tipton said.Blackmon also heard a rumor of a lady's picture hanging in the lobby of Belvin/Buchanan, that follows students when they walk by. The picture is of an old Residence Manager Mrs. W.H. Fannie Matthews.Blackmon, who lived on the ground floor of Belvin, said she knew someone (ghost-like) had to have been down there. ""My roommate and I used to hear footsteps. At midnight the door from the stairwell would open, and then we would hear footsteps throughout the hallway. When we looked outside, no one would be there,"" she said.Footsteps and weird eyes following people are not the only weird things that have happened to Blackmon. One day, one of her friends was in the community bathroom on the floor of the lobby next to the office. After washing her hands at the sink, she turned the water off and then suddenly, the faucets slowly turned back on and water rushed back out. Blackmon remembers the day clearly. ""My friend ran out of that restroom like a ""bat out of hell,"" she said.Natali Rhymes, a resident manager at Elliot Hall had some grueling stories to share also. ""I believe in ghosts, but I'm not sure how many of the stories are true,"" she said.""Back in the day, there used to be four dorm rooms on the ground floor. Supposedly, a girl was killed in her room. The rooms were then renovated into a lounge for the bottom floor. If you go to the ground floor of Elliot by yourself at nighttime, you're supposed to see a girl combing her hair in the reflection,"" said Rhymes.Anyone interested in seeing the facts for themselves will have to wait. A tar problem on the bottom floor caused the lounge area to be reconstructed. Now, the area is being considered for central staff offices.""When I was a residence assistant at Belvin, I would check the rooms and every time I went down there, I felt a presence. It always felt like there were two ghosts down there. If I ever went down there to study, I always felt safe, but I was never alone,"" she said.""I also remember one day when I was doing room checks by myself in one of the rooms - that was the last time I ever went by myself. I went to G73, and usually the doors stay ajar if you leave them open. I left the door open, but right after I went in the door slammed shut. It couldn't have been a gust of wind,"" explained Rhymes.Rhymes has had plenty of weird and freaky things happen to her, but the worst was when she was a house manager at the old Chi Omega House, now the Stuart House, which houses the Sigma Sigma Sigma sorority. ""When I first moved into my room, I hadn't heard any of the ghost stories. While I unpacked, I tried hanging my pictures, paintings and calendars up on the wall. Nothing would stay. In the bathroom, I had a shower caddy, you know the cart that holds hairspray, your face wash and so on. I hung that on the wall in the bathroom. Later on at night, like a dummy, I was there by myself when the residents hadn't gotten there yet and I was watching ""The Sixth Sense"" in the dark. If you know the part where the little boy says, ""when the little hairs on your back raise up, that's them,"" my shower caddy fell in the bathroom. It scared the living daylights out of me, so I called a friend of mine and we looked in the bathroom together,"" she said. ""After that night, I heard that an old Chi Omega alum hung herself in her shower of one of the rooms. Some of the sorority girls told me about the incident. Anyways, a little while after that, I was doing room checks and the room that she had killed herself wouldn't open with my master key. In fact, you had to go through the suite to get to the room. If you unlocked the door to the bathroom and left, and then came back, the door would be locked,"" said Rhymes.In Estill, Residence Assistant Jennifer Bernardi said she didn't really think any of the stories were true and that the pipes in the buildings were probably just really old. She did however comment on a day while the school was out for break, that she was doing room checks with one of the other RAs. ""We were on the fourth floor when we heard a lot of voices, and more than just six people. We thought the other RAs were all together having a little get together, but when we got down there, there was no one there,"" she said. Resident Manager Jessica Truscott, of Belvin/Buchanan Hall said she had heard the myriad of stories, but didn't think any of it was true. She said that the halls were spooky, but not ""ghost story"" spooky.""I think it's fun to think something happened because the buildings are so old,"" she explained.A faculty/staff member who didn't want their name published, said that there are ghosts in the Peabody Building and Austin Hall.In the Peabody Building, there is supposedly an older woman in a long black dress who visits the building in the daytime. If the music being played on the radio is not the music the ghost likes, she'll pull the cord out of the socket.In Austin Hall, an elderly maid stands at the end window looking out towards the courthouse. Sam Houston's ghost is also rumored to appear at nighttime in one of the back windows and also looks out."
15 students complete Designer Show Room,Houstonian: Sam Houston State University,"January 1, 1970 Thursday","This is the fourth year SHSU students have participated in the show. ""Students are able to develop a design space and apply what they have learned in the classroom,"" said Laura Burleson, assistant family and consumer sciences professor. ""They work to coordinate design elements, colors and textures while creating a functional arrangement of furniture pieces."" Student participation in the show house is unique to SHSU students. Other spaces in the show house are designed by professional interior designers from Conroe, The Woodlands and north Houston. ""The particular house we worked on contained a large bonus room,"" Burleson said. ""We developed the area into an elegant, but relaxed, space using a 'world travel' theme."" Using furniture and accessories borrowed from local designers and retailers, the students were able to create a tasteful, yet functional, room. Burleson said the room ""serves as a place to get away from the noise of the rest of the house."" The color scheme for the room pulls together rich red and gold tones against a background of harmonic tan. A comfortable sitting area and several classical game tables allow for more than one group to play chess or cards, or to just sit and enjoy classical music through the room's state-of-the-art, built-in surround sound system, she said. The room sits on the second floor of the show house, with a stairwell that gives way to a landing where a pair of hunting chairs used by the Chinese nobility a hundred years ago accent the area. In the game room itself, more Chinese influence is mixed with African and European art objects. The bathroom adjacent to the room profiles a mix of Indian elephants and exotic African items. Designing a game room was a new experience for the class. ""In the past, we have worked on a girl's bedroom and bathroom, a poolside living room, a utility area and a breakfast room,"" said Burleson. While it may be difficult to get 15 students to decide on a single design theme, work is divided and students concentrate on small areas so everyone gets hands-on experience. But experience isn't the only advantage to participating in the show house design. ""Other than actually developing a design space and applying what the students have learned in the program, they also have the opportunity to network with professional designers that may be in the position to hire them as an intern,"" said Burleson. She noted that seeing the work students are capable of doing oftentimes impresses those designers, which makes participating in the project an asset to the program. ""The SHSU interior design program is the only one in the Houston area that does a space like this as a class project,"" she said. ""This attracts new students to our program and makes the department, as well as the university, more visible to a broader community."" The show house is located 3.4 miles off of Highway 105 West at 94 Lake Estates Drive. It will be open for public viewing through April 21, from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Saturday, and 1 p.m. to 6 p.m. on Sunday. Admission is $10 per person."
Europe urged to play active role to mediate Russia-Ukraine conflict following trading of 'dirty bomb' accusation,Global Times (China),"January 1, 1970 Thursday","As the possible use of ""dirty bombs"" became the latest spotlight on the battlefield between Russia and Ukraine, Chinese experts warned that it would bring an inevitable escalation of conflicts that may lead to the eventual firing of nuclear weapons. They urged Europe to play an active role in mediating between the two sides, rather than be tied blindly to the American chariot. 

Russia intends to raise at the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday its accusation that Ukraine is planning a ""dirty bomb"" attack and has urged UN chief Antonio Guterres to do all he can to ""prevent this heinous crime from happening,"" Reuters reported on Tuesday.In a letter to Guterres and the UN Security Council, Russia's UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said they will regard the use of ""dirty bombs"" as ""an act of nuclear terrorism,"" urging Western countries to exert their influence on Ukraine to abandon its dangerous plans threatening international peace and security.""

Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky slammed Russia's accusation saying it was ""planning such an attack itself to blame on Ukraine,"" reported Reuters.

A dirty bomb, or radiological dispersal device, is a weapon that combines radioactive material with conventional explosives. It is said to act mostly through the effects of contamination on the environment and related health effects of radiation poisoning in the affected populations.

The main purpose of dirty bomb is to create an atmosphere of terror among the masses, experts said. 

Accusing each other over the possible use of dirty bombs reflects worries from both Russia and Ukraine on the use of weapons of mass destruction, which will cause the war to spiral out of control. ""Dirty bombs are despised and unaccepted by the international community. Once used, it indicates the use of nuclear weapons could possibly follow, and the escalation of conflicts is inevitable,"" Cui Heng, an assistant research fellow from the Center for Russian Studies of East China Normal University, told the Global Times on Tuesday.

Western countries have rejected Russia's allegation as ""transparently false,"" the foreign ministers of France, Britain and the US said in a joint statement.

US State Department spokesperson Ned Price said on Monday that ""It would certainly be another example of President Putin's brutality, if he were to use a so-called dirty bomb,"" adding that it was important that Moscow know the ""profound nature of the consequences"" should it engage in nuclear use, US News reported. 

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said on Monday that Russia's allegation that Ukraine is preparing to use dirty bombs in Ukraine is absurd. 

For the US and the NATO, as long as Russia can be defeated, they do not care what weapons are used, even if that would bring unimaginable consequences to the European continent, Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Tuesday.

However, there have emerged other voices in Europe that were once tied to the American chariot but now realize that they should not push Russia into a corner.

""Germany, in particular, has shifted tone on Ukraine in recent days along with some other European countries,"" Cui said. ""Not to mention a nuclear war, they can't even bear the consequences of the previous escalation between Russia and Ukraine, when both sides attacked civilian facilities. That was not in line with the security interest of Europe."" 

Experts urged Europe to stop blindly following in the US' footsteps and play an active role in being a mediator between two sides, as they are the most suitable parties and the ones that can actually make a difference.

Grand plans,Houstonian: Sam Houston State University,"January 1, 1970 Thursday","The APA puts a stamp of approval on the teaching and training schools offer, said Rowland Miller, professor of psychology and member of the doctoral faculty. It is the only professional organization that inspects graduate training programs.""Getting that approval is an extremely important mark of prestige,"" Miller said.He said schools inspected and approved by the APA have a much higher prestige and a form of quality control.Accreditation is the process of being inspected and approved.""Other consumers, employers and professionals know that if you've graduated from a program accredited by the APA, you have training that meets national standards,"" Miller said. ""You have to prove yourself before you're eligible for accreditation.""The practice of psychology is a program similar to the practice of medicine or law in that it involves years of training.""Our new doctoral program has just reached the point to be eligible for accreditation,"" Miller said.The department has to be in business for several years and have trained people before colleagues can observe what kind of professionals the school is creating.""This year we are nominating ourselves and undergoing a very thorough self examination,"" Miller said.After the self-study is finished, the results are sent to headquarters in Washington, D.C.""They inspect you from afar, but the big event is a visit to campus,"" Miller said.Colleagues from around the country will come and perform a face-to-face inspection for two days.""A three-person team will meet with the vice president, the dean and maybe the president,"" Miller said.The visitors will also talk with students and faculty behind closed doors.""It's a very hard couple of days for the visitors to find out everything they can about the quality of what the students encounter,"" Miller said.After the inspection, the colleagues report back to Washington, D.C., and a decision is reached. This process takes a few months.""The accreditation is given as soon as the decision is reached,"" Miller said.The psychology department will submit its self-study later this year and plans for a site visit some time in the fall, Miller said.""It's a very exciting time for our department,"" Miller said. ""Sam Houston's reputation is expanding by leaps and bounds in this field.""Accreditation benefits the institution, the faculty and the students.""I feel very privileged to be involved with such a prestigious program,"" said junior psychology major Josh Metteauer. ""The accreditation will hopefully help my future employment opportunities.""The classes that have been most enjoyable are the ones taught by professors who truly know their field and have been involved in it for many years,"" Metteauer said.""Accreditation puts your program on the map and it's a great advertisement that what you're doing is high quality stuff,"" Miller said.Psychology students train in the clinic on campus that provides many services to the community as well as the prison system.""Great things are happening here,"" Miller said.Miller was a site visitor for other schools such as the University of British Columbia, the University of Utah and the University of Tennessee.""It's very hard work, but you learn a lot,"" Miller said. ""I think we're in good shape. If I were site visiting from somewhere else, I would be very impressed, and my personal experience leads me to think our visitors will be impressed, too."""
Class debates apology to Afganistan,Houstonian: Sam Houston State University,"January 1, 1970 Thursday","The hour-long debate began with pro-advocates Presley McFadden and Shaun Stoehr arguing the U.S. should offer a formal apology to Afghanistan for the deaths of innocent civilians during air strikes in October.""We hold the position that the U.S. in all its power and all its strength should apologize to the Afghan citizens,"" McFadden said in his opening statement. ""Afghan citizens are dying because of a war that may not need to be fought and an apology is owed for the deaths of innocent people through this cruel and unusual act.""""The fact is innocent people are dying and that is wrong,"" McFadden said. ""Would you like an apology for the deaths of the innocent from the World Trade Center? I'm sure you would, so shouldn't we apologize for innocent people dying in Afghanistan?""McFadden added that a U.S. apology does not equal weakness.""By doing this we are not less patriotic or less powerful,"" he said. ""It is not weakness, it is meekness. Meekness is power under control.""McFadden and Stoehr also argued for what they called justice for all and said going after innocent people while trying to disband the Taliban is something that would never be condoned on American soil.""When someone in the U.S. commits and act of murder you don't go after their family or the community or the neighborhood in which they live,"" McFadden said. ""You go in and get the individuals involved and we think that is what needs to be done.""On the opposite side, counter advocates Heather Menzies and John Merrill stated their opinion that the country should, under no circumstances, apologize to Afghanistan. The mainstay of their argument focused on the great difference in the numbers of American and Afghan lives lost.""The Afghan civilian deaths are trivial compared to the U.S. losses from the Sept. 11 attacks,"" Menzies said. ""The numbers add up to a startling 5,364 American lives taken in one day compared to approximately 50 Afghan civilians that died over the course of two days of U.S. bombings.""Menzies added the U.S. should not apologize for the retaliation and that Afghan citizens are well aware that the U.S. is working in their interests by dropping food and offering to rebuild the country's government once the Taliban is defeated.""The U.S. has taken many measures to assist the Afghan civilians during the time of war with the Taliban,"" she said. ""Thirty-seven thousand five hundred food packages were dropped to starving civilians on the first day of air strikes all to underscore the message that the attacks are against the Taliban and not ordinary Afghans.""Both Menzies and Merrill stated the violent Taliban members have caused over one million deaths in Afghanistan and must be stopped. They also emphasized that after the Sept. 11 tragedy, Americans need to see powerful government action.""What we need to see now is a strong government, one that isn't afraid to step on a few toes,"" Merrill said. ""Absolutely no apology is necessary.""The debates continue Dec. 3 with ""Cell Phone Usage Should be Legal in all Automobiles."" The debates, which are open to all students and faculty, are held at 2 p.m. in Room 125 of the Dan Rather Communications Building."
Bearkat hockey rolling to play-offs,Houstonian: Sam Houston State University,"January 1, 1970 Thursday","We only need a couple of more wins to clench a spot.""The team's main concern is where it will land in the play off mix.""We want to be one of the top- seeded teams,"" Hannon said, ""because the higher you are, the easier the teams you end up playing. We are in the running for a good play off position."" The team's success is contributed to by a combination of new talent, veteran leadership and a larger roster, according to Hannon. The team grew from about 15 players to 22 this season.""We have a good freshman class. The young players are really helping out,"" he said. ""And some of the older guys have really started to develop.""The new comers have complimented the veteran talent, according to Hannon.Senior goalie James Winton and freshman goalie Steven Rydarowski have also made a huge difference for the team, Hannon said.""If you have a good goalie, you have a much stronger team,"" he said. ""And they've been just great.""The team will open spring play with a three-game series at the Shoot-out Hockey facility in Spring, Texas. The first game will be against UT-Dallas on Feb. 3 at 9 a.m., followed by Collin County Community College at 12:45 p.m. The Bearkats will finish off the day against Abilene Christian University at 2:15 p.m.""They're pretty good,"" said assistant team captain Cullen Klingbail. ""We've beaten them before. We'll probably beat them again.""However, the loss of Dustin Stromsness has left a whole in the team's game plan, according to Hannon. Stromsness was one of the team's bigger scores.""The younger guys are going to have to step up and pick up those goals,"" Hannon said. For the team to be a major contended in the play offs, he said the team is also going to have to play a better team defense and as a team better.""I feel we can contend if we do that,"" Hannon said.The increased club membership allowed the team to create a B-team for less experienced players, according to Hannon. With too many members for one roster, the team has split to give all players a chance to play. The team is 1-7 in its first year, but is doing well, he said. ""It's a learning experience,"" Hannaon said. ""It's been an up and down season for them.""Also in the works for the hockey team is a exhibition match between the Bearkats and the Stephen F. Austin State Lumberjacks, according to Stivers.""That's something I'd like to see, a Thursday night game with SFA and SHSU beating the hell out of each other,"" Stivers said.The team is working with Recreational Sports to arrange the exhibition for late this semester and a final decision should be made by April, according to Stivers."
Mark's Story,Houstonian: Sam Houston State University,"January 1, 1970 Thursday","In school, Mark was picked on a lot because of his size and the fact that he wore glasses, so he struggle to find a way to fit in with the ""rest of the crowd.""Drugs were the way Mark was eventually accepted by his peers. Despite his involvement with drugs, he graduated from high school and was accepted into a radiology program through the Harris County Hospital District.Although his parents were now divorced, they both provided Mark with the money he needed to attend school.""They paid for my books, tuition, spending money, everything,"" he said.Eventually, drugs took over Mark's life, and he flunked out of school. In an effort to get money, he agreed to help rob a store. His cousin, having previously worked at the store, already had a plan.What Mark didn't plan for was that his cousin would leave him during the crime, and he would be caught.""I faced 65 years in prison. When it was over, I got 12 (for aggravated robbery),"" he said.""Being in prison has forced me to grow up. Here, you have no privacy. You can't go to the bathroom or take a shower by yourself. Somebody tells you what to do, when to do it and how to do it. You miss the small things, like being able to talk on the phone or talk to your parents,"" he said, ""These are all things I gave up because I chose to commit a crime.""A main factor in Mark's life and the life of many other inmates in this program was the effect of peer pressure they felt during their lives. Now, he knows just being himself and making his own choices are the keys to success.""If you have to sacrifice your personal integrity to get other people to accept you, then, basically, you become a slave to other people,"" he said. ""You know if you get caught, you'll get in trouble, but because you want to be part of the group, you go along with it.""Mark said he has heard many young people who use drugs or drink alcohol say they didn't think it was fair that they get in trouble for something they feel doesn't really harm anyone.""What you feel has nothing to do with the law,"" Mark said. ""If you choose to use drugs or to drink alcohol and drive, whether you feel like you can handle yourself or not, it's against the law, and there are consequences for what you choose to do."""
Not what it's 'crowned' up to be,Houstonian: Sam Houston State University,"January 1, 1970 Thursday","Following difficulties with requiring all Homecoming candidates to be sponsored by an organization, the Student Government Association altered the procedure this year. Under the new SGA procedure, all students could apply to run for Homecoming titles following a screening process and payment of a $25 application fee.Brooks said after being crowned last year, she expected her role as Homecoming Queen would allow her the chance to represent the university. ""I was extremely disappointed,"" Brooks said. ""I wasn't asked to attend any campus events, even just to sit there as a representative of the students-nothing.""The most exciting part of being named Homecoming Queen happened on the day of the game when my name was announced and I was given the crown,"" she said. ""I thought that was just the beginning, but that was it; there was nothing else.""Brooks said she expected the title would allow her a chance to be more than merely a figurehead.""We did nothing at all,"" Brooks said. ""I haven't even heard from anyone at the school about when or if I need to be there on Saturday to pass the title on to the new Queen.""Carlton Green, interim director of Student Activities, said the practice of electing a Homecoming King and Queen for SHSU is held in keeping with tradition and following crowning, the winners are not expected to perform any special duties.""They aren't asked to do anything; we've never asked them to,"" Green said. ""We hold the election because it is Homecoming and the winners get the honor of being chosen. We don't ask them to attend certain campus functions as King and Queen.""SGA President Helena Banks agreed Homecoming royalty are rarely asked to take part in campus functions, but added that is something the organization would like to see changed in the future.""We don't really call on the King and Queen for anything; right now being elected is just a fun thing for them,"" Banks said. ""SGA would like to see them more involved at campus activities, but at this point, there is the question of what to have them do there."" Banks said although not officially invited to campus events as royal representatives, the Homecoming King and Queen are always welcome to make themselves known.""Another thing is for them to say they would like to help out,"" Banks said. ""They would be more than welcome to be a part of any campus activity.""Brooks said while being crowned Queen was an honor, she thinks it is a common misconception among students and nominees that the role of Homecoming King and Queen will not end with the Homecoming festivities.""It was a great honor to be elected as Homecoming Queen for Sam Houston State University,"" Brooks said. ""I just didn't feel like I got to do anything. This year's nominees need to be prepared for that."""
Walker County Fair and Rodeo wants student involvement,Houstonian: Sam Houston State University,"January 1, 1970 Thursday","""One of the things you hear from Sam students over and over is that there is nothing to do in Huntsville, so we have a perfect facility out there for trying to bring in things for the students to do and the music festival works just right.""SHSU student Erin Kny said the efforts by the Walker County Fair and Rodeo board are a positive sign for students and the board.""Anything that they do for students is good,"" Kny said. ""We are a resource for the Huntsville community, and getting us involved is good for both groups. We (students) may not be the biggest resource in the area, but we do make up a large number of people who have time and money to spend. I'm glad they want to involve us.""Moak said the music festival has been a good start for events at the fair grounds, but they are continually trying to think of new ideas to bring students out and keep them in town on the weekends.""Each year we're going to have a music festival, but we want to expand that and do things similar to that several times a year,"" Moak said. ""Part of that is doing something during the fair. There's more out there than animals and projects, but we have to get the students out there to realize that. We built a huge stage in the back, in the barbecue area, that looks up the hill, so we can do things throughout the year.""Moak said the board is always looking for ways to draw the college crowd to the rodeo, and they want to get ideas from students so they can get something people are interested in.""We are going to have a lot of different music acts out there this year,"" Moak said. ""Bluegrass music, folk music, country music, rock music and Tejano music are a few of the types of music. We're trying to hit a broad base and we need ideas for what else we can do in the future to bring people in.""The fair will also have a closing event on April 6 that will boast a local band that might draw students out.""For our closing dance we have River West performing. They're a local band that's pretty big,"" Moak said. ""I'm hoping we get some of the college students out here for that. (College students) know them; they've played at Shenanigan's and played around here so that has a possibility to get the Sam Houston students out there. Most of the guys in the band are from Sam so hopefully that will bring out some folks."""
Cell phones and men,Houstonian: Sam Houston State University,"January 1, 1970 Thursday","Why do students use cell phones? Are men or women more likely to dial up friends and family using the small hand-held inventions?At SHSU, it seems women are far more likely to use cellular phones, although men also appeared to make use of cell phones regularly.Dr. Douglas Constance, assistant professor of sociology, said sociological theories begin to explain the differences in how men and women make use of the available cell phone technology.""Functionalist sociological theory would assert that women naturally are more expressive and emotional. As a result, they talk more and keep in touch with their friends and families,"" Constance said. ""Similarly, men are much more instrumental and goal oriented. They tend to use phones for more business reasons and less in keeping contact with friends and family. Male Bearkats said while cell phones are commonly used among men in the business world, at the college level they primarily use them to keep up with friends. ""I use my cell phone to talk to friends mostly; it's also good to have one so in case of any kind of emergency, my family can reach me,"" freshman Brandon Filla said. ""It also makes it easier for the ladies to get in touch with me.""Constance agreed that in many cases, men use cell phones to form quick, convenient connections with friends. ""I think, in general, cell phones are used more to keep up with friends than family,"" he said. Some male students disagreed and said they frequently use cellular phones to keep up with happenings on the home front.""I use my cell phone a lot to talk to family back home,"" Filla said. ""I like to know what is going on with my family.""""I almost always use my cell phone to talk to my family,"" sophomore Dustin Savage said. ""However, I also use it to keep up with friends and my girlfriend.""Savage and other male students said another reason they use cell phones is to take advantage of the cheaper long distance rates.""I use my cell phone as my only source of long distance,"" Savage said. ""It's a lot cheaper that way and you don't have to deal with the expensive phone companies.""Constance also noted differences in the amount of time men and women spend during telephone calls and said it can be viewed as a result of socialization.""A social constructionist perspective would argue that men and women are not naturally expressive and instrumental, but rather we are socialized by our society through our culture, families, friends, church and community to adopt our assigned masculine and feminine roles,"" Constance said. ""As a result of this learning, women talk more and longer on the phone and also talk about many more subjects. Men, however, tend to talk less often and in more business-like conversations that are short and to the point.""Men on campus said that whether it represents a socialized behavior or not, women do talk via regular phones or cellular ones, much more frequently.""I don't know why but women just like to talk more, especially when it's on the phone,"" Filla said. ""They like to use their cell phones to gossip more about drama. They also seem to use them on the road more often, which can cause accidents.""Men just don't talk as much and so they don't use cell phones as often,"" he said. Savage said cell phone usage just depends on the person and cannot be confined to gender.""I think it's a cop out to say men use them less, or women use them more,"" Savage said. ""It just varies depending on different things, like if you need to use a cell phone for your job.""Everyone is using cell phones now,"" he said. ""They are popular with both men and women and will probably continue to be."""
Prof Profiles: Dr. William Green,Houstonian: Sam Houston State University,"January 1, 1970 Thursday","After 29 years on the faculty at SHSU, Green is the chair for the department of economics and international business while also serving as the mayor for the City of Huntsville since 1995.Green attended three different colleges while working on his degrees, starting at Abilene Christian University and then transferring to Lamar University in Beaumont where he obtained a bachelor's of business administration degree in economics.From there, Green went to Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge where he received his master's and a doctorate in economics.Green said it was almost accidental that he decided to major in economics because it was not until his junior year that he had an economics class; however, he enjoyed the subject, and wanted that for his field of study.""Up until that time I really did not have a major and I was really unsure as to what I wanted to do, but after having my first economics class I decided 'this is what I want to do and this is what I want to major in,'"" Green said.Green said he enjoys walking and playing golf in his spare time, but he enjoys learning first.""I get a lot of enjoyment out of seeing what my students learn,"" Green said. ""I enjoy learning information that I teach, so always learning new things is part of the joy and also I enjoy when I see that students are learning things and beginning to understand concepts and ideas that they were not made aware of before.""Jenny Yates, a senior who has taken an introduction to economics class with Green, said he was able to relate the class material easily to the students because of his personal life experiences.""(Green) would tell us about his experiences that related to the subject, which was helpful as far as relating the material to the class,"" Yates said. ""He was passionate about his teaching style because he could relate to the subject matter.""M. Douglas Berg, SHSU economics professor, said after knowing Green for seven years he has found him to be civic-minded, outgoing and good at looking out for other people's interest.""I think he is a valuable member of the Bearkat community here,"" Berg said. ""He has been here for a long time and I think he has been an instrumental part of the team of leaders on campus who helped the College of Business and the university to grow in stature.""Green can take a part of the credit in leading the university and the college in that direction, Berg said.""I have found that he is very good at looking out for the student's interests, I have always found that to be true,"" Berg said. ""I have heard him advise students and I have heard him in meetings and discussions and often time he is pretty good at taking into consideration all sides and I think he really tries to be fair.""Berg said students could walk away from Green's class with a better view of how things work in the world, while also gaining a better idea of how international trade works.""Whether you are trying to improve something in the department or trying to balance objectives against resources, I think he does a good job of teaching that,"" Berg said.Understanding the world from an economic perspective is one of the many things Green said he would like students to gain after taking one of his classes.""You can look at things around you in a variety of ways and I would hope that as (students) view things that happen in the world, and as they observe events as they live their lives, that they can see things in a more analytical way, and look at this from at least one perspective, from an economic perspective,"" said Green."
Laramie Project' wins award,Houstonian: Sam Houston State University,"January 1, 1970 Thursday","""In Texas, we have four different levels of the competition,"" Hasekoester said. ""There is the local level, the video level, the regional level and the national level. Our next round is the video level. We will submit a tape and a portfolio with the director's statement, program, photographs and things that show how we put this show together and what we were thinking.""The highest level of the competition is Nationals, which is held at the Kennedy Center American College Theater in Washington, D.C. Several SHSU actors won awards at the festival for their performances in the play, including Joel McDonald for ""Excellence in Acting"", Crys McDonald for ""Excellence in Stage Management"" and Kevin Crouch for ""Excellence in Video Effects"". These students were selected at the local level by a regional committee and will move on to the regional level.Theatre students Spencer Plachy, Sofia Gomez and Chelsea Fry received nominations for the Kennedy Center American College Theatre Festival Irene Ryan Scholarship Award at the competition. These students will also move on to the regional level at a February competition in Fort Worth, Texas, if selected. Hasekoester said she is very pleased with the results of the competition.""It's really exciting that we advanced with the show. It was a very difficult play to do, very challenging for the students,"" Hasekoester said. "" 'The Laramie Project' is a show that focuses on the people in that community and (deals with) the questions of 'how do we teach each other to hate?' and 'how do we break away from it?' """"The Laramie Project"" is the tragic story of Matthew Shepard, a 21-year-old student at the University of Wyoming who was beaten to death because he was gay. Shepard met his attackers at a campus bar in Laramie, Wyo., on Oct. 7, 1998. They told Shepard that they too were gay in order to lure him to a remote area later that night, where they tied him to a split rail fence and tortured him.A cyclist found Shepard nearly 18 hours later. He was still tied to the fence, unconscious, covered in flood and numb from hypothermia. He died five days later at a Colorado hospital.The play, written after Shepard's death, stirred controversy in the media. The Tectonic Theater Project of New York went to Laramie and interviewed residents to get their response to the murder. The script was written based on Laramie residents' response.After the play was written, it was quickly dubbed ""one of the 10 best plays of the year"" by Time magazine.Eight regional chairs from the Kennedy Center American College Theatre supervise the festivals and award distribution on the local and regional levels. The program attracts participation from about 1,800 students from colleges and universities across the country each year. Nearly 160 million people have attended the 10,000 plays that have been performed by schools participating in the competition.The Kennedy Center's founding chairman, Roger Stephens, created the program in 1969. Eight SHSU students, including Kregg Daily, Haley Dyes, Sofia Gomez, Joel McDonald, Spencer Plachy and Sarah Ripper portrayed 60 different characters in SHSU's performance of the play. Senior Crys McDonald served as stage manager. ""The Laramie Project"" was performed at SHSU Oct. 2 through Oct. 5."
Wife of student seeking to create care packages for National Guard members,Houstonian: Sam Houston State University,"January 1, 1970 Thursday","""Anything that can entertain them.""Sgt. Murray and the rest of the troops in his battalion have been sent to guard a chemical weapon stockpile at an anonymous military post. The troops are expected to remain at the stockpile for at least a year.Barbara Slifer, a public affairs officer for the U.S. Army, said the troops arrived at the post in August and were processed in on the Aug. 19. She said the number of troops activated from the local Huntsville battalion is approximately 200.The troops have been placed at the post in order to protect the stockpile from terrorist attacks. Slifer said the soldiers would remain on the post until a new incinerator is completed, to destroy the stockpile."" (It's) so we can destroy the chemicals safely our way, and not someone else's way, "" said Slifer.Slifer said the military post that houses the chemical stockpile normally has a population of about 40 soldiers, but after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the federal government has authorized for more active soldiers on the post.Title Ten of the United States Code states the federal government reserves the right to activate reserve troops in the case of a national emergency, such as an invasion or a rebellion. The title, first issued in 1956, makes all National Guardsmen members of the U.S. Army Ready Reserve.Senior Jennifer Price said she supports the activation of the troops.""I think they should take on that duty with pride, because their country needs them,"" said Price. ""I think they should do their duty to the best of their ability.""Krista said that while most people seem to be aware of the hard work soldiers are doing in Afghanistan, most people do not know the danger soldiers stationed in the United States face.""I think that people forgot that we have those people there,"" she said.Krista said the troops currently are working long days at the post, in 16-hour shifts, and the care packages will help alleviate the homesickness the troops feel and also show them their work is appreciated.""These guys are in a very stressful, dangerous situation, and I think we should support them and remember that,"" Krista said.Krista also said she was informed that when his time comes for a furlough, her husband will only receive a one or two day break before having to report back to the post.Slifer said the federal government is currently planning to activate more reserve troops to be deployed at the post, in order to lessen the work of soldiers already stationed there.Krista said she is hoping to gain supporters mostly through word of mouth, and that whenever people have anything they can spare, to just give it to her or her husband's sister and mother, Carolyn and Janice Murray.""Not everyone can just send something,"" Krista said. ""It has to got through a central person.""Anyone interested in sending a care package can contact Krista at 435-1848."
Mardi Gras: taking over Galveston,Houstonian: Sam Houston State University,"January 1, 1970 Thursday","We, here at The Houstonian, would like to give you an insider's look at what exactly is going on at this year's Mardi Gras and show you how Mardi Gras Galveston came to be.Arriving in Galveston as far back as 1867, Mardi Gras was traditionally known as the ""feasting and merrymaking"" that precedes the season of Lent, a spiritual holiday used to obtain spiritual purity that runs from Ash Wednesday to Easter Sunday. Partiers would use this festival to fulfill all of their eating, drinking and sinful desires in order to get them out of the way so they would not be tempted during the abstinence of the Lenten season.After a 57-year absence on the island, the yearly sensation made a triumphant return to Galveston in 1985 after a local island native and his wife decided to bring back the cherished tradition. Since its return, the American version of the European festival Carnival has been entertaining thousands.Over 100 years after its establishment, this festival seems to fall back to its original intent by providing a place to deliver an outlet to get a lot of partying out of the way. It is now celebrated by thousands who do not acknowledge the season of Lent, but that's a whole different discussion...Whatever your reason for going to the Galveston party, you are almost guaranteed to have a good time. Employees around the island have been working around the clock to make sure this year lives up to the expectations of the past.According to Chris Woolwine, special events manager for the Park Board of Trustees, 2003 Mardi Gras Galveston will be the best ever.""We've lined up some fantastic entertainment, worked endlessly with the 17 participating Krewes (Committees or social clubs that coordinate parade floats, balls and fundraising activities for the Mardi Gras season),"" Woolwine said on the mardigrasgalveston.com homepage. ""We've also reached out to the entire community to make Mardi Gras 2003 the most successful of its kind so far.""More than 50 bands will entertain spectators on three grand stages located in the heart of the Strand Downtown Historical District. Performances at Galveston will include many famous artists, such as: Three Dog Knight, Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, and Seth James.There will also be several parades taking place this weekend. Each parade will give the opportunist a chance to collect Mardi Gras memorabilia and help make their Mardi Gras experience more enjoyable.On Saturday, the Krewe de Esprit Rosaire Procession parade will kick off at 11 a.m. This parade will travel down Seawall Boulevard from Menard Park to 31st Street. At 6:30 p.m. the Knights of Momus Grand Night Parade will travel down 21st and Seawall to 25th Street.On Sunday, the Krewe of Barkus and Meoux Paw Parade will start at 1 p.m. and venture down Avenue M and 25th Street to the Railroad Museum. At 2 p.m. the Krewe of Munchkin's Parade will start on Avenue N and travel back down 25th Street to Railroad Museum ending the weekend's parades.The party isn't over when the parades stop. The rest of the evening is left to the creative minds of the Mardi Gras participants who journeyed down to Galveston Island. Everyone knows the most memorable festival does not begin until the sun goes down.We, here at The Houstonian, encourage everyone going to the annual festival to have a great time, but also to be safe. There are an unlimited number of bad things that could go wrong whenever you place several thousands of people in the same general vicinity with one another, so please do not go alone.People wanting to take part in this celebration better act soon because Mardi Gras Galveston ends on Fat Tuesday, March 4th.For more information regarding performance and parade times, please visit www.mardigrasgalveston.com.Take advantage of this yearly event because you will not be able to experience Mardi Gras again until next year. Relax, have fun, and take some friends because they too will have a good time."
Muslim hopes to bridge religious gaps,Houstonian: Sam Houston State University,"January 1, 1970 Thursday","He hopes to bridge the growing gaps between the various religions of the world.""Some individuals and the media misinterpret the Koran. They misinterpret Islam. If you want to know something about Islam, ask a Muslim or read the Koran,"" Muhammad-Bey said.Each spring, he puts a display in the Newton Gresham Library with the purpose of educating and informing the public on the true nature of Islam. He has also worked to make more resources available for students to obtain the correct information on this religion.""A few years ago, I was actually told by someone with the library that there was not a need for more information on this subject. That need has grown, especially since what happened on Sept. 11,"" he said. Muhammad-Bey added that the increased need is due to professors giving assignments related to Islam and general curiosity from the public since the attack on the twin towers.""There is now a lot of information, books and CD-ROMs now available at the reference desk here,"" he said, ""Islam is now the second largest religion in the world. We see people of all races coming to Islam, not just African -Americans. There is a large number of Hispanics who are now Muslim.""According to Muhammad-Bey, true Muslims want to establish peace, although they do believe in 'an eye for an eye.' They believe in defending themselves, but killing innocent people is not an option. ""As a Muslim, if I have a problem with you, I will come to you. I'm not going to go out and blow up hundreds of innocent people. This is not the way of Islam,"" he said.In addition, Muhammad-Bey said he feels the biggest misconceptions non-Muslims have about Muslims is that they are anti Christ. He said people tend to look upon Muslims as unbelievers or disbelievers, but he said, ""That is not true. That is 'his-lam' or 'their-slam'; that is not Islam.""People interpret the Koran the wrong way. If you want to know how to be a Christian, read the Bible. If you want to know how to be a Muslim, read the Koran. The Koran, the Bible and the Torah are all the teachings of the same God,"" he said.In 1996, a mosque was opened in Huntsville to serve the needs of Muslims in the community and to educate the public on the Islamic faith. As imam of the mosque, Muhammad-Bey speaks to local churches and civic organizations, helps new Muslim students adjust to the United States and SHSU and works to create a greater understanding of the Muslim religion.The mosque, located at 800 10th St., holds services on Fridays, and non-Muslims are welcome to attend the services. ""If someone wants to know the truth about Islam, they can come there, and I will help them understand,"" Muhammad-Bey said, ""I will even give them a Koran if they would like to read one.""A major concern he has is that today's youth are being mislead, especially young black men. In his experience, Islam has helped younger people overcome issues in their lives, he said. ""Islam has certain values a person has to adhere to. A major one is discipline. It's hard to have discipline in this society,"" he said.Muhammad-Bey works for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice as a substance abuse counselor. He also helps inmates cope with prison life and find resources available to them after they are released. ""I'm not here to convert anyone,"" he said, ""I work with the (Muslim Students Association), and we promote diversity and multi-culturalism."" Muhammad-Bey is also a member of Amnesty International and feels strongly about equal rights for all, regardless of color, sex or disability.In a recent article, the Union-News said Muhammad-Bey ""seems unhardened by hard times. He has come to embrace a non-racialized Orthodox Islam.""""I'm just a peaceful man, trying to do the right thing,"" Muhammad-Bey said."
Ramadan : the Muslim month of fasting and prayer,Houstonian: Sam Houston State University,"January 1, 1970 Thursday","It is a time of worship and contemplation and a time to strengthen family and community ties.""It's a time of reflection and temperance,"" said freshman Louisa Rezgui. ""You're putting yourself in another person's position. There are people in other countries who don't have any food,"" Rezgui said. ""That's why you're supposed to fast, to put yourself in their position.""The month of Ramadan is also when it is believed the Holy Quran ""was sent down from heaven, a guidance unto men, a declaration of direction, and a means of Salvation."" Ramadan, the ninth month of the Muslim calendar, is a time when Muslims concentrate on their faith and spend less time on the concerns of their everyday lives. During the Fast of Ramadan, strict restraints are placed on the daily lives of Muslims. They are not allowed to eat or drink during the daylight hours. Smoking and sexual relations are also forbidden during fasting. At the end of the day, the fast is broken with prayer and a meal called the iftar. In the evening following the iftar, it is customary for Muslims to visit family and friends. The fast is resumed the next morning.According to Muslim belief, they may eat and drink at anytime during the night, until a white thread can be plainly distinguished from a black thread by the daylight. They must keep the fast until night.Several things can destroy the good that is acquired through the fast: the telling of a lie, slander, denouncing someone behind his back, a false oath, greed or covetousness. These are considered offensive at all times, but are most offensive during the Fast of Ramadan.""Fasting is prohibited for women who are pregnant or on their menstrual cycle, people on medication, children under 12, those who are insane, people who are traveling and the elderly,"" Muhammad-Bey said. ""The fast can also be made invalid by intentionally eating drinking or having sex during the month.""During Ramadan, it is common for Muslims to go to the mosque, Masjid, and spend several hours praying and studying the Quran. ""We read 1/30 of the Quran each day so at the end of the month, we have read it entirely,"" Muhammad-Bey said. In addition to the five daily prayers, during Ramadan Muslims recite a special prayer called the Taraweeh, or night, prayer. The length of this prayer is usually two to three times as long as the daily prayers. Some Muslims spend the entire night in prayer""We're trying to attract students to the Mosque for the celebration of Ramadan instead of them fasting and praying just in their homes,"" Muhammad-Bey said.A main focus during Ramadan is on charity. Muhammad-Bey said it is a time for a peaceful state of mind and for doing good things.""We give up free time to help others, not just with money, but with kind words,"" he said. ""If you can do this for 30 days, then you can do it all year long.""On the evening of the 27th day of the month, Muslims celebrate the Laylat-al-Qadr (the Night of Power). It is believed by Muslims that on this night, Muhammad first received the revelation of the Holy Quran. And according to the Quran, this is when God determines the course of the world for the following year.When the fast ends, the first day of the month of Shawwal, it is celebrated for three days in a holiday called Id-al-Fitr, or the Feast of Fast Breaking. Gifts are exchanged. Friends and family gather to pray in congregation and for large meals. In some cities, fairs are held to celebrate the end of the Fast of Ramadan. ""It's a peaceful month when you become closer to your family,"" said Rezgui."
The haunting history of Halloween,Houstonian: Sam Houston State University,"January 1, 1970 Thursday","The ceremonies were meant to help the Celts divine the future, and to bring comfort to them during the long winter.During the Dark Ages, Christianity began to spread to Celtic lands, and in the 8th century Pope Boniface IV sought to replace the ceremony with a more Catholic friendly version. Nov. 1 became All Saint's Day, in which the souls of Catholic patron saints were celebrated instead of Celtic deities.The old English word for All Saint's Day is Alholowmesse (All's Holy Mass), and the celebration the night before was now named All-hallows Eve, which eventually evolved into Halloween after centuries of dialectical change.The custom of trick-or-treating comes from parades that were held on All Saint's Day. People would be given a pastry called a ""soul cake"" in exchange for praying for the souls of the giver's dead relatives. Eventually the custom had children going from house to house in their neighborhood to collect the cakes, along with ale, food and money.Senior Krischele Jenkins enjoys the holiday because of her religious background.""I love it, it's one of my favorite holidays,"" said Jenkins. ""For me, because my religion celebrates it as All Saint's Day, and we celebrate to honor the saints that died throughout the years.""And also, because autumn is my favorite season,"" she said.Centuries later, when immigrants moved to the United States, they brought their Halloween customs with them. However, because of America's Puritanical history, the holiday was not well received at first.In the late 19th century, however, there was a push in the United States to make the holiday more of a community get-together. The idea of centering the day on children became popular, with parties being held that focused on games and costumes while taking the supernatural elements out of it.Senior Traci Hudson said that she never really got into the holiday.""I like giving out the candy, but I don't like dressing up,"" said Hudson. ""I don't like going up to strangers houses and asking for candy.""Junior Kelli Ellsworth also didn't celebrate the holiday in the traditional way, but instead found other activities to do on Halloween.""We never really celebrated it,"" said Ellsworth. ""We still did the candy and costume thing, but mostly we just hung out with friends at their houses.""People introduced trick-or-treating back into the holiday between 1920 and 1950, and it soon took its modern incarnation of children going from door to door to collect candy. Society also brought the idea of dressing up in ghoulish costumes during the holiday. With sales of candy, costumes and other related item, Americans spend about $6.9 billion annually on Halloween, making it the second most commercially productive holiday behind Christmas.Terry Rosati, RTV professor and 90.5 station manager, said she enjoys the season because of the opportunity for children to have fun.""I think it's a good time for you people to go out and be something different, and have some fun,"" said Rosati.Rosati remembered her childhood of trick-or-treating in Minnesota, and how she didn't stay confined to just her block.""I'd go into other neighborhoods just so I could get more candy,"" said Rosati. ""And I ate it all, too!""Rosati also said that when she was a child, Halloween was more innocent and children did not have to worry about the things they have to now.""We didn't have to worry about pins and razor blades in the candy,"" said Rosati. ""Now they have x-ray machines at the hospital.""Still, Rosati said she missed the fun of trick-or-treating during Halloween.""I wish I could still go,"" said Rosati."

The board will make the final decision on the candidates for TSU's new president.""We opened up our candidacy here in September for anyone to apply, David applied and he was selected for a personal interview, which we did in late January,"" Rawlings said. ""Out of that group he was selected as one of the finalists to participate in a campus visit.""Interviews from the three finalists are scheduled for February and early March, and the Board of Governors anticipates making a final decision on a new president for TSU no later than April 2.""There are three finalists and he was selected as one of those three and those names have now been transferred from what was the search committee to the Board of Governors,"" Rawlings said. ""At Truman State, the Board of Governors, which is a controlling board at the university, will actually make the selections.""Payne is scheduled to visit TSU on March 4 and 5 for two days of meetings with different members of the campus community at TSU.""In the meetings (Payne) will have for the two days he is here, he will be meeting with lots of different constituencies on campus including administrative people, staff, faculty, students and board of governors, so that we get a chance to know him a little better and he gets a chance to know the campus and the people here a little better,"" Rawlings said.The three finalists have all served as vice president for Academic Affairs at their respective universities.Prior to SHSU, Payne has also served as vice president for Academic Affairs at Emporia State University for eight years and was the dean of college of Social Sciences at Southeast Missouri State University for six years in the 1980s.He holds a bachelor's of science, in Sociology from Brigham Young University and a, master's of arts and doctorate in Sociology from the University of North Carolina.Bregman is the provost and vice president from Academic Affairs at Longwood University and has served as VPAA since 1997, and he was named provost in 2000.

Program Council hosts 81st Annual Tree of Light ceremony,Houstonian: Sam Houston State University,"January 1, 1970 Thursday","The event, which is sponsored by Program Council, will feature entertainment, food and the lighting of a 20-foot tree with thousands of twinkling Christmas lights.According to Monica Schmidt, programming chair for the event, students will notice preparations for the event taking place throughout the week.""They will be setting up the big, main tree Tuesday in the center right in front of the Administration Building,"" Schmidt said. ""The lights will not be strung until Wednesday and won't be turned on until the ceremony. We will also be decorating the trees with ribbons.""Schmidt said the ceremony will showcase many types of performances from various campus organizations.""The Soul Lifter's and the Sam Houston Chorale will be singing Christmas music, and the Orange Pride Dance Team will be there to perform,"" she said. ""We will also have either a poem or a paragraph read about Hanukkah and about Kwanza to try to make the ceremony more diverse.""Schmidt said one of the main purposes for the event is to give both SHSU students and the Huntsville community a chance to help those less fortunate than themselves.This year's Tree of Light ceremony will include both a food drive and the collection of wrapped toys for underprivileged children.Organizations and students attending the event are encouraged to bring nonperishable canned food items to donate. Although in the past the ceremony's donations have benefited the local Good Shepherd Mission, this year the food will be given to the Huntsville SAAFE House.""This is the first year we've donated the food to the SAAFE House instead of the Good Shepherd Mission,"" Schmidt said. ""They were really excited. Since they are a lot smaller, they usually don't get a lot of donations.""They are going to try to get someone from the SAAFE House to be at the ceremony to say thank you and said if they are unable to do that they will arrange for someone to pick up the food right away so it can be put to good use.""Schmidt said students may also bring wrapped toys for the Huntsville Fire Department's ""Toys for Tots"" program. She added that all wrapped toys should be labeled by gender and age group.""That way they won't have to open all the gifts or try to see what it is,"" she said. ""It will keep an 8-year-old boy from getting a Barbie doll or something.""Schmidt said in the past while individual students have made donations, the largest contributions have come from student organizations that donate as a whole. Campus organizations may sign up to donate and be recognized at the ceremony.""Organizations who sign up will be called, and one or two people from that organization will be able to bring their donation down and be recognized during the ceremony for giving,"" she said. ""There will also be a time for individual student donations and donations by organizations that did not sign up for official recognition.""The organization that gives the largest donation of food and toys will be rewarded with a pizza party.Hot chocolate, hot apple cider, egg nog and a variety of cookies will be served at the event to fend off the cold and raise holiday spirits. All food will be free of charge at the ceremony with Program Council and the Student Government Association footing the bill.Schmidt said although President Gaertner and other university officials will be unable to attend due to a Board of Reagents conference, she expects a good turnout of those who want to get into the holiday spirit and give to others.""At Christmas time people like to get into the spirit of giving. They decide to be a nice person around this time of year,"" she said. ""The Tree of Light ceremony is an easy way for people to give and feel good about giving, without having to go far.""Schmidt also hopes students and faculty will attend to witness what is one of SHSU's most longstanding traditions.""It is one of the oldest traditions we have at Sam,"" she said. ""We don't have many true traditions that stay the same over time. This is one we really try to keep up with and students should take part in it."""
What will I dream of tonight?,Houstonian: Sam Houston State University,"January 1, 1970 Thursday","Lambert said the mind is processing spiritual data, beliefs, psychic intuition and any communication from God.""All of this data is a form of chaos, and your mind puts it together in a form of visual screenplay,"" he said. ""The screenplay is a medley of sight, sound, emotion and imagined interactivity.""Dr. Deirdre Barrett, a researcher, teacher and author at Harvard Medical School said when we dream, our brain is in a psychological state.""We mainly have the same brain activity, but it is in a different state of consciousness,"" Barrett said.In 1953, sleep researchers discovered a connection between dreams and rapid eye movement during sleep. The studies revealed that every night we have several five- to 40-minute periods of REM sleep, during which dream images are produced by sensory neurons.Most people do not remember their dreams. Barrett said if people do remember their dreams, it is because they woke up immediately after a period of REM sleep.""Short-term and long-term memory is not active during REM sleep,"" she said.In order to recall your dreams, Barrett recommends lying very still as soon as you wake up.""Try to recall what your dream was about and focus on the points of your dream that you remember,"" she said. ""Then, write them down immediately or just think about the dream.""Keeping a dream log of your dreams will also help your dream recall. By writing down a few dreams, it will help you to recall future dreams.""Some people have written down all of their dreams,"" Barrett said. ""It helps them to analyze themselves.""Research has shown dreams serve a purpose in our everyday lives. Barrett said creative-problem solving, health improvements and increased peace of mind can all be strengthened within our dreams.""Dreams are a different mode of thought, and they show more visual and emotion,"" she said. ""Dreams are a better indicator to supplement working through problems.""Dreams also have access to information unavailable to the conscious mind.""Dreams may show that you're concerned about certain work-related challenges even before you start feeling the stress yourself,"" Lambert said.Dreams can also help you avoid a problem. In dreams, you may rehearse certain situations. For example, an important speech, a meeting with a client or trying out a new sport can all be rehearsed in your dreams.""When you get more accustomed to your dream life, you will also be able to take better advantage of the creative potential of dreams by trying to have dreams that help solve your problems,"" Lambert said.According to Barrett, we should especially pay attention to recurring dreams, and the small differences in the dreams indicate the problem. ""These are the details we should pay attention to, because they hold the clues to the meaning of the dream,"" she said.Although we may not make the changes in our lives that cause us to have the recurring dream, taking notice of the dream may end it.""Even if you haven't taken action, the dream may suddenly stop,"" Barrett said. ""This means that the dream is just an indicator of a pattern in your life that you should take notice of.""Many dream dictionaries are available to help us interpret the symbols in our dreams. Barrett said the dictionaries with several meanings to a particular symbol are the best to follow.""You have to think about the symbols and analyze them,"" Barrett said. ""Think about how you feel about the particular symbol (like a closed door) and what your previous memories are to the symbol.""Dreams are not meaningless or random events. All dreams have causes, generally from emotionally charged life events. Themes and issues experienced in dreams are situations a person may not be able to deal with directly.For more information about dreams, check out Dr. Deirdre Barrett's books, ""The Community of Sleep"" and ""Trauma and Dreams,"" which are available in bookstores."
Technology crisis at the liquor store,Houstonian: Sam Houston State University,"January 1, 1970 Thursday","He and his staff at Big Red Liquors use black lights to help them examine holograms on any number of state licenses that come through their doors. They check campus directories to see if students' addresses match those given on the licenses. And they grill people whose birth dates look doctored _ often keeping the IDs they suspect are fake.""I'll ask them what their astrological sign is, just to see how they react,"" Ludy says.Now his store and several others near college campuses in Indiana have added one more tool to foil potential underage drinkers: They're using scanners that read the bar codes and electronic strips on the back of most states' driver's licenses.The devices are gaining popularity with liquor retailers, police officers and bar owners nationwide as fake IDs get ever-more sophisticated and difficult to spot.These days, students can order fake IDs from any number of Web sites or from fellow students, usually for $100 or more. Often, the more expensive fakes have holograms on them to make them appear more real.""As they get better, we need to get better,"" says John Livengood, president of the Indiana Association of Beverage Retailers, which has several members testing the scanning devices for this month's hard-partying college homecoming weekends.Officials in Florida were among the first to use scanning devices, targeting beach towns that are popular college spring break destinations.""There are literally thousands of people arrested,"" says Major David Myers, commander of the northern region for the Florida Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco.Myers says most underage drinkers caught with fake IDs are ordered to appear en masse in court the day after they receive their citations. Some pay a fine. Others opt to do community service by doing trash pickup.""Panama City beach is one of the cleanest beaches in the country after the spring-breakers get done cleaning it up,"" Myers quips.At Indiana University _ ranked by The Princeton Review as one of the nation's ""top party schools"" _ students wondered how much effect the scanners will really have.One 20-year-old student whose ID was confiscated at Big Red Liquors last spring said he thought the scanners would be a ""discouragement"" to some students.""But it's not going to help with the overall problem,"" says the student, who asked that his name not be used. ""As long as the drinking age stands, there will always be underage drinking.""Several students said having a fake ID was considered almost a rite of passage _ one that could generally get them into a busy bar, if not a liquor store (though some bar owners say they plan to start using scanners, too).""Most people I know have fake IDs and if they don't, they know where to get them,"" says Trisha Brazelton, a 19-year-old sophomore.Jordan Conover _ a 22-year-old junior who had a fake ID before he turned 21 _ says he believes there should be more focus on educating students about the dangers of binge drinking, which has claimed the lives of college students across the country.Even those who use the scanning system concede that it is not, by itself, the perfect solution.Some retailers note that the scanners sometimes don't work if a license is bent.A few states _ Alaska, Wyoming, Oklahoma, Tennessee and New Jersey _ don't have bar codes on their licenses, though many have plans to add them. Georgia licenses also have coding that can't be read by most scanners, Myers says.And already, some who make fake IDs are adding bar codes that actually work in some basic scanners. (The IDLogix devices used in Indiana are tougher to fool because they can detect when the bar code information is not provided in a particular state's exact format.)Before they started using the scanners, employees at the 15-store Big Red Liquors chain in Bloomington still confiscated about 100 fakes a year _ some of them downright laughable. One, for example, turned out to be a computer-generated Tennessee look-alike ID stuck atop a hotel key card.Donna Lattanzio, general manager of the Village Bottle Shoppe liquor stores near Purdue University in West Lafayette, says she's become very good at spotting fakes. But she's glad to have the scanners as a backup _ for one, to help her fend off belligerent students who argue that their IDs are real.""Not today, pal,"" she often tells them before sending them on their way. ""'Stupid' is not written on my forehead."""
"Jewish students, faculty prepare for Passover",Houstonian: Sam Houston State University,"January 1, 1970 Thursday","The history of Passover dates back to the history of Israelites living in ancient Egypt. According to the book of Exodus, the Jewish people were slaves under Egyptian rule for more than three centuries.In the year 2448 on the Jewish calendar, or 1312 B.C. according to the modern one, the Hebrew prophet Moses traveled to the capital city Thebes to convince the Egyptian Pharaoh to release the Jewish people. When the Pharaoh refused, God cursed Egypt with various plagues, including turning the Nile River into blood, and creating infestations of pests such as frogs and locusts.When the Pharaoh still refused to release the Israelites, Moses received preparations from God concerning the final plague. In order to escape the plague, people in Egypt were to prepare a meal of lamb and then smear the lamb's blood above their doors.The firstborn son of any family who did not obey the edict would die, but the spirit of God would ""pass over"" the homes that followed the commands. After the Passover, the Pharaoh finally relented and let the Israelites go.Sophomore Jason Plotkin, president of the Jewish student group Hillel, said the custom of celebrating the Passover is the most celebrated Jewish event of the year. During the first two evenings of Passover, a ritual called the Seder takes place, in which the family gathers to eat a special meal and retell the story of the Jewish exodus.""Throughout Passover, Jews who keep the Passover refrain from eating chametz (leavened products) such as breads, and the reason for this is because the Israelites were in a rush leaving Egypt, so the bread had no time to rise,"" Plotkin said.During the Seder, a special meal is prepared called the Seder plate, with each item on the plate meant to represent the dispersion of the Jewish people from Egypt.The Seder meal includes parsley and other greens for renewal, a mixture of fruits, nuts and wine called haroset for labor, bitter herbs such as horse radish to represent when life becomes bitter, a roasted egg called betza for free will sacrifice to the temple, a sheep shank bone to symbolize the lamb that was sacrificed, salt water for the tears of the Jewish people and Matzoh bread for the unleavened bread the Israelites ate while fleeing Egypt.Plotkin said his family spends the holiday singing songs in Hebrew and reciting prayers, such as the traditional blessing of the wine. He said his family takes turns reading a paragraph of the account from Exodus, with many family members reading a specific paragraph reserved for them.""The actual Seder itself is my favorite Jewish event of the year because our family has many traditions that I look forward to year after year,"" Plotkin said.Sophomore Amy Mabel said that this Passover, her roommates will be attending her family's Seder in order to learn about the holiday from a Jewish perspective.""We read the story of Passover, but we also explain so that people who are not Jews who come to our house can understand it,"" Mabel said.Mabel said she hopes people will learn more about Passover and its place in Jewish history.""Personally, I like to know about everyone's traditions because that's important to me,"" Mabel said. ""So I think those interested in learning about anybody's culture should respect other people's traditions and inform themselves.""Associate Dean of the College of Business Administrations Mitch Muehsam said Passover is a reminder to him of how to treat other human beings with respect.""To me, the celebration of the holiday is recognition of what the holiday is meant to mean, and how it helps you be a better person,"" Muehsam said.Muehsam said that from the Jewish perspective there is no real connection between Easter and Passover, and that Passover is a time to reflect on history. Since Huntsville does not have a large Jewish population, he said there are only three things he and others can do, reflect privately on Passover, meet with a group of friends, or leave town and visit with family or another community that does have a large Jewish base.Muehsam added that Jews tend to view Judaism as a way of life and not as a religion. He said the holiday is intended to be a reminder of what occurred in the history of the Jewish people.""We would not in any way put people in a place that we were in,"" Muehsam said. ""The value of freedom, the value of the right to follow your own faith and we should respect other people's desire to follow their own faith."""

Athletic scholarships are no game,Houstonian: Sam Houston State University,"January 1, 1970 Thursday","""We work one year in advance.""Thompson said juniors and seniors must acquire a certain percentage of hours, according to the NCAA guidelines, and cannot take classes that do not count in their degree plan.""If they want to take one of these classes, then they must take all required classes first,"" she said. Before an athlete is allowed to compete, he or she must be eligible, according to the NCAA guidelines. Thompson ensures that all athletes are eligible by being sure they have a degree plan on file and have maintained a GPA of 2.0 or higher. ""We check to be sure every player of every sport is eligible at the beginning of the season and then once a week,"" she said.All athletes are required to have their grades checked for each class at least three times a semester, according to Thompson.If an athlete fails a course or falls below the 2.0 GPA, a coach makes the decision on whether to work with the athlete to bring the grades up or to replace the athlete.""If an athlete fails a course, they are asked to repeat the class the following semester,"" Thompson said.She said if the student has a significant problem with his or her grades, then she will offer help with tutorials but athletes may lose a scholarship.""Knock on wood, we haven't had to deal with it much,"" Thompson said. ""But we have to support the dean's decision and the coach's decision to retain or replace the player.If an athlete is severely injured, the coach must determine whether the student can be useful in other areas in order to keep a scholarship. These areas may include laundry or other duties determined by the coach.Freshmen scholarship athletes are not allowed to have jobs so they can adjust to college life and learn time management skills. They are also required to participate in CHAMPS, a life skills class taught by Thompson.Thompson said the CHAMPS class is designed to teach study skills, communication skills, the NCAA guidelines, sex and drug awareness, deciding on a major and other life skills that will help them.Senior, junior and sophomore athletes are allowed to have jobs but are not allowed to exceed their scholarship amount. ""The NCAA requires that we monitor these requirements very closely,"" Thompson said. The NCAA allows athletes to practice for four hours a day and is required to have one day off. If a competition lasts more than four hours, the rule is waived. If traveling is required for a game, the team is allowed to use the players' day off for traveling. In addition to classes, athletes have four hours of practice a day. P.J. Traylor, a free safety for the SHSU football team said his day begins at 7 a.m. with a team meeting. After their classes, the players meet with their special teams or other players in their position at 2:15 p.m. At 2:30 p.m. the players meet with their groups offensive or defensive groups. At 2:45 practice begins and later ends at 5:45 p.m. On Sundays and Wednesdays, the football players include weight lifting with their training. Every athlete does community service work through the Bearkat Mentor Program.""The athletes mentor a young student who is at-risk and tries to provide a good role model for them,"" Thompson said. ""And we have some great role models here."" Thompson assists the athletes by providing them information on tutorial sessions and having tutorials available in the evenings. ""We have a convenient computer lab for the athletes to use and I post study groups for those in particular classes who need help,"" Thompson said. Some athletes including football players are asked to stay over the summer to practice on their sport. If they stay, they are asked to participate in summer workouts.""Summer training was very intense. I think it has been one of the major factors in our success,"" Traylor said. ""Summers are geared more toward getting in good condition for the season.""Coaches choose scholarship athletes based upon their performance, academics, personality, financial ability and ability to be a team player. But, these factors must be maintained through out an athlete's college education."

Women's football team qualifies for national tournament,Houstonian: Sam Houston State University,"January 1, 1970 Thursday","17-19 and advanced to national competition. It will be held at The University of New Orleans Dec. 27-31. Goin' Deep had scored 441 points in 12 games without letting its opponent reach the end zone. Allowing the Vixens, from Stephen F. Austin, to score in the opening play of the championship game of the regional tournament was more than scary, it was earth shattering. Being behind 15-0 at half time was a quick reality check for Goin' Deep. After their nerves settled down it was clear that the team had to concentrate on finding a way to score 15 points in 20 minutes.Everything in the second half of the game that needed to happen to give Goin' Deep the win happened. After Tamara Nichol's throw to Jennifer Cron finally put Goin' Deep on the score board, it was evident that stopping Goin' Deep would take more than the SFA's Vixens could handle. ""I knew that if we just caught the ball and played the way we can play we would be all right,"" Coach Danny Bennet said.Goin' Deep tied the game with 1:50 to go. Once they got used to the Vixen's style of offense, which consisted of long passes, tricky backward pitch passes and confusing running plays, they were able to shut them down and they showed the Vixens why they had never allowed an opponent to score on them in past games. One of the biggest plays of the game came when Nichols, the quarterback, went in the game on defense and caught an interception that put Goin' Deep in position to score the winning touchdown.When the clock ran out of time Goin' Deep had fought back and won the tournament by beating a team 22-15. They hold a record of 14 wins and no losses. Eight of the wins were in Sam Houston's intramural games and six were in the tournament. After winning the tournament the team has scored 463 points to its opponent's 15 points.Goin Deep is made up of Tamara Nichols, Brandi Bode, Jennifer Cron, Lhea Lucien, Leah Gross, Lacy Jester, Angie Kent, Jamie Lucas, Kristie Lucas, Jenny Maisel, Karla Slimp, Annie Hermann and Coach Danny Bennet. Bennet said the members of Goin' Deep are all great athletes. ""I feel like I can put any player out there at any spot at any time, so it's good that we have players like that,"" Bennet said. Some of the team members have experience playing on the collegiate level. Cron played volleyball for Sam Houston and is the current assistant volleyball coach. Nichols played softball in junior college and for Sam Houston. Bodie was on the track team and volleyball team at the University of Texas at San Antonio. Maisel played volleyball at The College of the Southwest and Alvin Community College and Gross played softball for Sam Houston also. At the tournament Kristie Lucas and Cron were selected as members of the All-Tournament Team, and Nichols received MVP of the tournament. ""I wish that they would have given more of those awards out, everybody on our team deserves something,"" Bennet said. ""I think every player on the team, at one point in the tournament, made a big play.""Winning the tournament is no small feat. It is the only regional tournament in Texas and the 24 teams that made up the bracket were from Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Arkansas. ""Winning the tournament is not as easy as it looks, we were able to jump on top of the teams early and get them out of what they were comfortable with,"" Bennet said. To get to the championship game Goin' Deep beat a team from San Angelo State 48-0 and a team from the University of Texas at Dallas 26-0. The team also beat a team from McMurry State 24-0 and won a game against West Texas A&M 28-0. In the semi-final game it beat one of Baylor's teams 26-0. The other single elimination regional tournaments were hosted at Arizona State University, Ohio State University, The University of Massachusetts, The University of West Florida, The University of Maryland, The University of Nebraska and UNC Willmington. The winners of the regional tournaments, as well as the second place teams, will play at the National Intramural Flag Football Championship Tournament next month.The members of Goin' Deep will travel to New Orleans to play in the tournament and said they are very excited and are glad to represent Sam Houston State."

Islamic imam discusses religious impact on Black History,Houstonian: Sam Houston State University,"January 1, 1970 Thursday","Let me begin by listing a few names in a test of your recognition skills. If you heard the name, Malcom-Jamal Warner, Kareem Abdul Jabbar, Jamal Wilkes, Muhammad Ali, Ahmal Jamal, the singer Kashif, the sports commentator Ahmad Rashad, would know they were associated with Islam? Perhaps you can help me with more names. The point we are making is that the Islamic influence among African-Americans is an acknowledged fact and growing.If you would visit any daycare or kindergarten class you would often find up to 30 percent of the class with names such as Sheriff, Saudi, Jasillah, Kareem, Akbar, Ahmed, Ali, Abdullah, Muhammad, Daud and others. These reflect the phenomenal growth, saturation and permanency of the Islamic movement in America.However, this aspect of American and African-American history has been neglected, and we feel quite deliberately. Even when it is acknowledged, it is distorted or slanted in such a way that it is portrayed as an aberration rather than a major factor in the development of positive self-awareness or social and economic advancement of African-Americans.I am sure that if I asked a non-Muslim, to expound upon his or her knowledge of Islam, they would perhaps say they heard of Malcolm X or had read his biography. Or perhaps they would say that they have read newspaper accounts of the Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, or have met some Muslim followers of Imam WD Mohammed, or perhaps a noted immigrant Muslim scholar.What is really known or understood, however, about Islam or its true relationship to the African-American thrust for freedom and equality?Let us look at the material on Malcolm X, also known as EL-Hajj Malik Shabazz. How much of this material deals with Islam, that is, the fundamental beliefs, the values, morality and traditions of Islam that made the man what he later became?Frankly, we hear only of his militancy, only of his nationalism. He was in fact, disconnected from Islam, the religion, except that he was known to have been a member of the Nation of Islam for the better part of his life and reportedly accepted the Universal teachings of the Holy Qur'an, which was revealed to Prophet Muhammad in the last days of his life.Most do not attribute the values of Islam, its inspirational message and other aspects to Malcolm's rise from the seamy life to that of a role model. Is this not the same with Muhammad Ali? Notice that the focus is on the heroics, and the man and not on the principles of his beliefs, nor his practice of his faith.Let us look at the case of Alex Haley, the ""as told to"" author of Malcolm's biography, and the author of ""ROOTS."" Actually ""ROOTS"" was written because of a Muslim challenge to Haley suggesting that he did not have true knowledge of himself nor his Islamic heritage.When Haley was able to get funding, he proceeded to do the research and behold that his ancestors were in fact Muslims. As you can recall, however, this fact was presented in a very minuscule way in the movie ""ROOTS."" When the television series was completed, we recall the Islamic aspect was all but forgotten.Islam's growth in America really represents an infusion of these universal forces in a situation that has broken down. The moral and religious community in America has allowed the neglect, distortion and misuse of essential principles of the unity of life that only through the infusion again of those principles essential to human life and excellence will save the coming generations.Is it any wonder that Islam would not be the inheritance of the African-American? Especially when it says that 'They who seek shall inherit the Earth.""African-Americans have been trying to fight racism, bigotry and hatred all their lives. Let us ask, however, why has Dr. King's ""dream"" gone unrealized? Perhaps because the ""real"" desire of the people was simply to be ""accepted."" There is the rub. When a people strive all their life to be accepted by their oppressor or otherwise dominant class, they, byimplication, have accepted and inculcated the concept of inferiority.Now does that mean that one should go to the other extreme to become an island unto one's self? No, but it does mean that one should separate one's self from the ethics and morality of the oppressors, including conflicting religious values and practices. Although it has been acknowledged, the movement of Islam, which does portray man as a sinner from birth but proclaims that man was made in the best of mold, has influenced true dignity, confidence and well being in thousands of African-Americans.Of course, we acknowledge that we live in a political world where heritages and roots are going to be important for a long time. We, nevertheless, must put these things in perspective; otherwise we will lose our sense of perspective and more importantly, our relationship with the universal laws that govern our existence.Today, God willing, the twain shall meet and given the inevitable dominance of Islam, America shall become the ""promised land,"" where the dream of Dr. King and others will become a reality.Upon you be peace."
SHSU professor returns from Afghanistan,Houstonian: Sam Houston State University,"January 1, 1970 Thursday","Soon after he arrived the weather became extremely hot, with temperatures often reaching 130 degrees.While stationed, Lohmann and others operated an airport that served as the logistical hub for northern Afghanistan. His worked with local contractors on construction projects and he was responsible for administrative duties while monitoring supplies.Lohmann worked with locals daily. He spoke about Americans being greatly appreciated and respected in northern Afghanistan. ""There were some times when the tensions were higher than others, most of it simple posturing,"" Lohmann said. He said while he never had to shoot anyone, he did have to raise his weapons once or twice. Before leaving for Afghanistan, Lohmann felt the terrorists couldn't be reformed or dealt with rationally when it came to the campaign against terrorism. ""I thought they hated us because of our beliefs; that they had very intense emotions and were completely dedicated,"" Lohmann said.His opinion is even more resolute now after seeing how the locals were and recognizing the appreciation they have for America. ""They hate the terrorists as much or more than we do,"" Lohmann said. ""They had to live under their rule for years and they continue to suffer intimidation.""Lohmann said the terrorists had no idea what they were up against. The United States is far more advanced in technology and the training and motivation of U.S. soldiers can be lethal. ""Some of our enemies have a serious misunderstanding of our culture and radically underestimated the U.S. citizen's resolve and our military's capabilities,"" Lohmann said. While Lohmann was in Afghanistan, little fighting occurred other than squabbles among the local warlords. There are three main factions of Afghans in the area, organized by ethnicity, and each faction is led by a warlord. The warlords worked hard to get their power and are hesitant to give it up. ""The warlords operate much like the mafia and it complicates the mission of everything else,"" Lohmann said.The U.S. pays the local warlords for ""protection"" according to Lohmann. He said there were times they didn't see eye to eye and suddenly something would pose a threat. At one point counter threats were made but the warlords along with all Afghans understood firepower and backed down quickly. Lohmann had little free time while stationed in Afghanistan. ""We were very restricted in what we could do and there was very little free time,"" Lohmann said. ""It wore us down after a while but for the most part we didn't mind working all the time because there was nothing else to do."" When he did have time to himself, he usually read or slept. Towards the end of his time there he was able to shop in town and drive through the mountains. While in Afghanistan Lohmann had access to a satellite phone and could call home every Thursday if he finished work during phone hours. The time difference made it difficult to call and the mail service wasn't very timely. Lohmann said his family has transitioned easily since his return and is grateful he no longer has to spend months away from home.Lohmann spoke in depth about the media coverage of the war. For the most part he feels what is reported has been accurate and somewhat timely. He also said the media reports what will sell papers. ""Sometimes I feel it's almost like they want our soldiers to get killed so they will have a story. Nobody writes about how much they appreciate our freeing the people from oppression and ending 23 years of fighting,"" Lohmann said. Americans don't tend to hear about the positive interaction that happens daily.Lohmann was amazed about the support the U.S. troops received while in Afghanistan. Every time mail arrived, there were countless packages from family, friends and community members. ""We received several packages from the SHSU ROTC program, Dr. Pruitt's history classes, the Conroe VFW and several other organizations in Southwest Texas. There was such an abundance of supplies, the camp was able to share things with some of the humanitarian organizations that did not receive as much support.All in all, Lohmann feels the war has been a worthy effort. ""Not just for our country but for Afghanistan and the whole region,"" he said. ""I know it's clich but we all take freedom for granted. Visit one of these other countries and see the fear and intimidation the people have been living with for years and you will see how good we have it. Freedom isn't free."""

"Guys, girls, and video games",Houstonian: Sam Houston State University,"January 1, 1970 Thursday","The student body of SHSU is no exception to this rule. Sitting outside the Lee Drain Building, elementary education majors Mandi McClure and Autumn Smith discuss the issue.Smith and McClure say they don't play video games but ""we watch our boyfriends play them.""Smith does play a couple of computer games like solitaire or the coin-op trivia game at a restaurant she frequents in Houston.McClure, however, has no desire for them. ""I would rather find something else with my time than play a video game,"" she says. ""They're not exciting to me. Your fingers start hurting, your thumbs start hurting after awhile. I don't think it's fun.""McClure admits she did play games when she was little. ""I always liked Mario Brothers.""But she is convinced games have changed a lot since then. ""They're bloody, they're gory. It's like watching a horror film and you're the person killing all of these thingsit's blood and guts in these video games. It's like seeing something real.""""I agree with her,"" says Smith. ""Some of them are too violent.""An article in PC Review last year stated, ""The violent, often sexist content of many games is cited as not only a turn-off to female players, but as a prime reason why girls don't bother with engineering and computing careersThe few women characters (in video games) tend to be S&M variations of Barbie tough, pneumatic chicks with skin-tight, skimpy clothing (can Lara Croft really scale rocky ledges in those hotpants?)""Smith says that some of the video games out now do portray females negatively.""It is skimpy,"" agrees McClure, ""and I understand that. But I also see it as this woman who is taking all these challenges that some women might not do. I think she (Lara Croft) is showing somewhat of a positive message.""Still, McClure and Smith don't play the games but have to frustratingly watch as their boyfriends engage into the latest games on the market.So why do guys enjoy games so much?""Honestly, I couldn't tell you,"" says McClure.Computer science major Edward Williams plays games to relieve stress and for a challenge. And ""to win,"" he says casually as he sits in front of a chessboard.Williams enjoys strategy-type games the most. ""Because, not only do you have to think, but you also learn about history in the process"". Williams says he has learned quite a lot about certain, historic battles by playing war strategy games on his computer.""And then of course, simulations,"" is William's specialty.In addition to being a student, Williams is the audio designer for the award-winning tank simulator, ""Steel Beasts,"" which debuted on computer game store's shelves in the U.S. last year and has just hit the European market in early February.To explain the interest guys have for video games, Williams uses the example of a flight simulator. ""I can't just go down to the airport and fly a plane, right? But I can get on a flight simulator. And fly!-something that I wouldn't normally be able to do.""As for more violent games, Williams says, ""I do like fighting games and pointless shooting games like a first-person shooter"", but he doesn't think they are too violent. ""As long as you know in your mind that there's a difference in what you're playing and what's expected in reality. It's stress relieveyou get mad, and get on the game and you blow up some aliens or something.""Are most of the games coming out now geared towards males?""Yeah,"" says Williams. ""I would say that men dominate the industry, they create the games. Usually whoever's making the game they come up with an idea of a game that they want to play. Well, that's one reason. The other reason is to just make money off the game but that's the wrong way to do it.""So, are there any girls who do play video games?""Some girls are into it,"" says Jessica Aguilar, a senior finance major. ""Like my roommate.""Aguilar says her roommate (a female) likes games with a good storyline and challenge her to use her mind.WomenGamers.com, is a company who reviews video games, movies and perform a variety of other services. They describe themselves as ""a fun, female-friendly, community-nurturing research tool.""Their website states, ""While it was certainly true in the past that many more males played computer games than females, the gap has been closing for some time now. Currently, there is only a 7 to 15 percent margin between the number of males who play games versus the number of females.""Still, with the gaming industry going the way it is, girls like McClure, Smith and Aguilar have little or no desire for playing games."
John Michie performance and Tam Dean Burn play honoured at Scottish theatre awards,Scotsman,"January 1, 1970 Thursday","The 62-year-old was recognised for the best male performance at Scotland's annual theatre Oscars for his role as a haunted fire service commander in a new play inspired by the two devastating fires at the Charles Rennie Mackintosh-designed Glasgow School of Art building.Michie, who had described his character's ""personal disintegration"" during the the play, was praised by the judges of the Critics' Awards for Theatre in Scotland for ""a heart-wrenching dignity and subtlety.""The best ensemble prize went to Lost At Sea, a fishing industry drama which Outlander, Outlaw King and River City actor Tam Dean Burn starred in just weeks after an alleged stabbing incident after a poetry event. He was treated in hospital but was released later the same day to recuperate at home.Michie, whose character made his return to the stage at Oran Mor, in Glasgow's west end in April, last than two months after rapper Ceon Broughton was sentenced to eight and a half months behind bars for manslaughter after he gave 24-year-old Louella Fletcher-Michie the hallucinogenic dug 2-CP at the Bestival event in Dorset.Michie had been in a break from filming the drama series Our Girl in Malaysia when his family was struck by tragedy in September 2017 but resumed filming around a month later.In Rob Drummond's play The Mack, Michie played a fire chief trying to come to terms with the tragedies he has witnessed over the years, while Janet Coulson played an expert on Mackintosh and James McAnerney played the architect himself.Speaking at the start of the run of the play, Michie said: ""I try not to think about Louella too much otherwise I wouldn't be doing what I'm doing now. It will never go away completely. There can be a cathartic side to acting where you can get some stuff out of it and there's a little bit of that in this role.""Mark Brown, one of the critics on the ""CATS Awards"" judging panel, said: ""John Michie played the role of the traumatised fire commander with a heart-wrenching dignity and subtlety.""His performance conveyed with reverberative power the emotional reckoning of a stoical, west of Scotland man who, following the first fire at the Glasgow School of Art, is finally brought down by a career's worth of trauma.""Tam Dean Burn, who played the lead role of the skipper in Lost at Sea, starred alongside his Local Hero co-star Jennifer Black, as well as Gerry Mulgrew, Kim Gerard, Ali Craig, Helen McAlpine, Andy Clark, Thoren Ferguson and Sophia McLean. The Moray-set play also saw Ian Brown honoured as best director.The judges said: ""Morna Young's Lost at Sea is a requiem to the fishermen of the north-east who perished in the waves.

John Byrne's 'pop-up book' Cheviot stage to go on display at Dundee V&A,Scotsman,"January 1, 1970 Thursday","Now artist and writer John Byrne is to be honoured by Dundee's new museum of design when it displays a huge ""pop-up book"" he created for the groundbreaking play The Cheviot, the Stag and the Black, Black Oil 45 years ago.Byrne admitted he had thought his hand-painted sets, which will be going on display at the £80 million V&A Dundee attraction when it opens in September, had been ""lost forever"" before discovering they had been secured for the nation several years ago.Byrne's backdrops are going on permanent display following years of restoration work carried out on after the book's acquisition following the death of writer John McGrath.The National Library of Scotland, which has agreed to a 25-year loan, has also carried out an extensive 3D mapping exercise on the biggest book in its 27 million strong collection.

Movie brings Holleywood to untsville,Houstonian: Sam Houston State University,"January 1, 1970 Thursday","This investigative thriller stars Kevin Spacey, Kate Winslet and Laura Linney. The plot for the film centers around a female news reporter who is sent to Texas to cover the story of David Gale, a former university philosophy professor who is now on death row. During her three, two-hour granted interviews, the audience sees flashbacks of Gale's life unfold, and viewers discover the circumstances that led him to his current predicament.Fellow reporter Jacob Brooks and I braved the crowd at the Holiday Inn Express Saturday in hopes of getting a slice of stardom pie, or at least gathering an interesting story.It is questionable whether either happened.We arrived at Holiday Inn, the makeshift movie-central for the day, at the start of audition time (10 a.m.), thinking not too many people would turn out so early.It seemed other Huntsvillians had the same idea.Waiting in line for over an hour afforded us the opportunity to eavesdrop on our fellow competitors. While the guy in front of us boasted of his intent to usurp Kevin Spacey for the lead role, a girl behind us was engaged in a conversation with herself-""If they want ghetto, I can BE ghetto.""While I was surveying the crowd wandering what individual talents I could offer the film, Jacob was busy scheming how to hop the fence near us and wait for his call ""pool-side.""The two of us soon found out what we would be able to offer the film-nothing. We didn't get picked as extras.Upon arriving at the front of the line, we were ushered inside to a conference room and filled out short applications. The applications requested some personal information, but mostly they questioned us on specific items. For example, we were asked if we were able to ride a horse, if we could play any musical instruments and the make/model of our car.Jacob thought his confession of the ""shitty condition"" of his car might intrigue the crew. I have no talents and listed my only ""cowboy abilities"" as the fact that I ""looked good in boots."" Neither response proved pleasing.After snapping our mug, the two of us were politely thanked and asked to leave the building. No 15 minutes of fame for us.On our way out, we noticed that not everyone that was around us in line was being asked to leave.""They told me to stick around because they wanted to interview me upstairs,"" said Kim McCullough, senior history/English major. A girl pulled McCullough aside and told her to have a seat for a while, and she would be given a personal interview.Jennifer Halverson, casting assistant for Beth Sepko casting (who is working for Valor Films, the production company), was picking out certain individuals to meet one-on-one with the casting director in an upstairs room of the hotel for a filmed interview.""We're looking for an authentic, and mind you, in a movie, stereotypical sense, a real Texan type. I'll tell you, we're not looking for really good looking people, we're looking for 'real' people,"" said Halverson.""Not necessarily are the people we're picking right now the ones that are going to get call-backs,"" continued the Selector Elitetress. ""We're just taking a sampling of people.""""I didn't get picked,"" admitted Huntsville High School senior Cody McKinley. ""I decided it would be a good experience to come out today. I didn't really know what to expect.""McKinley exited the building almost as quickly as he entered.Claudia Cliff, a Huntsville resident who has community theatre experience, was another of the applicants chosen to interview.""I brought in a professional headshot, but the lady taking applications told me to put it away because the casting director was just looking for 'real people.' I'm not nervous-just glad I got asked to stay,"" said Cliff. ""I've got my lucky pink sweater on.""Jacob and I weren't wearing our lucky sweaters.At least our applications would be mixed in with the others. At noon, I was applicant number 175, and interviews would continue until 6 p.m. that evening.""The director will not only look at the casting director's taped interviews but will look at all the applications and Polaroid pictures,"" Halverson assured me. ""We have some big scenes that we'll need a lot of people for.""Though the film is set in Huntsville, actual filming is only scheduled for Nov. 26-30. The majority of scenes are being filmed at a set in Austin.""A sports-bar-in-Huntsville scene was just filmed in Austin. This is done mainly out of ease since the cast and crew are already there,"" said Halverson.I think Zach's got shafted.Filming is scheduled to conclude Dec. 20, with a fall 2002 release date for the film.Movie work gave me the munchies. Following my rejection, my main concern was finding a place to eat. Jacob had other plans.""I may go into seclusion and live in a cave,"" mused Jacob on his rejection. It's probably better neither of us got picked for the film.The role of the journalist was already taken."
Investiture of President James F. Gaertner,Houstonian: Sam Houston State University,"January 1, 1970 Thursday","As I emphasized to our academic leadership at a recent retreat, it is vital that Sam Houston not only provide a welcoming atmosphere for minority students, but also provide the students with academic role models. In keeping not only with closing the gaps, but with our moral obligation, we must continue to attract increasing numbers of minority students, but we must do a better job of attracting outstanding minority faculty and staff."" The Investiture started at 2 p.m. Thursday with a procession of about 300 SHSU faculty dressed in appropriate cap and gown. Behind the faculty, also in black gowns, were over 100 students, each representing a different student organization.Surrounding those in gowns were close to 1,000 people, including students, staff, alumni, special guests and the SHSU Symphony Orchestra and a conglomerate of choirs, who played and sung a variety of patriotic songs throughout the event. After the procession of faculty, there was a Posting of the Colors by the SHSU ROTC Color Guard, the singing of the national anthem, a prayer by President Emeritus Bobby K Marks, and then introductions by Master of Ceremonies Dr. James R. Miller.A variety of ""greetings to the president"" speeches followed from Student Government Association President Stephen Sargent, Associate Vice President for Student Services and Dean of Student Life Frank Parker, Faculty Senate Chair William P. Fleming, President of the Alumni Association Advisory Board Richard A. Hartley, Mayor of Huntsville Bill Green and Rep. Jim Turner (D-Crockett), who presented Gaertner with U.S. flag that had flown over the Capitol in Washington, D.C.After the orchestra and choir performed ""From Sea to Shining Sea,"" Chairman Dionicio Flores of the Texas State University System's Board of Regents was introduced to perform the installation of the new president.""I charge you with the 12th presidency of Sam Houston State University,"" said Flores as he placed a golden seal with a white ribbon around Gaertner's neck.Gaertner then went into his acceptance speech by first welcoming special guests and thanking his family and friends for what they have meant in his life. He also thanked the university staff. ""They are so often the forgotten stakeholders who literally make the wheels of the university run,"" Gaertner said of the staff.He also said what an honor it is to ""serve as the president of the third oldest state-supported university in Texas.""We are now in our 122nd year, so history heritagetraditionthese are all important words for us at Sam Houston and we will always celebrate that history,"" he said.Shortly after, Gaertner got to the heart of his speech by outlining the current status of his administration's efforts and accomplishments since taking over last year.""The preliminary planning and hiring has begun to launch a major capital campaign for Sam Houston State, a big part of which will go to faculty enrichment. We must be certain that our annual fund is in good shape before we launch this very ambitious initiative; and I urge all of you to consider making a significant contribution to that annual fund drive,"" he said.""We are moving to build badly needed new student housing. We hope to have the requests for proposals ready for Regents' consideration in May. If all is in order, and subsequently approved, new student housing should be ready about 18 months from now, in the fall of 2003,"" he said.Gaertner also discussed that the University/Community Council, which formed last September, has had several productive meetings to date; a President's Circle is being created-pulling together a small group of influential alumni and friends of the university in order to gain support and get the word out about SHSU; the Presidential Speakers Series has recently received funding and two weeks ago had its first speaker, Gene Stallings.Gaertner wrapped us his speech with a metaphor, comparing SHSU to an oak tree.""Today, Sam Houston State University is much like a huge old east Texas oak tree. The roots of our history run deep and give us continuity and stability. And the branches of Sam Houston State grow taller and taller, and their reach is wider and wider renewing that growth every year, just as we are celebrating a renewal today. These branches are always reaching out to students, faculty, alumni, friends, to the region and to the world. It is our purposetogetherto ensure that this wonderful university continues to build on its strong foundationand never, never stops reaching."""
Celebrities speak out on war,Houstonian: Sam Houston State University,"January 1, 1970 Thursday","In recent weeks with the invasion of Iraq, the United States has been in a tug of war with its very own citizens. With mixed opinions on our role in the world today, protests grow more hostile as both anti-war and troop supporters' loose focus on the real issues. There have been hundreds of protest arrests nationwide, over 1,000 in San Francisco alone, not to mention other arrests around the globe.With all the attention on the war, some celebrities have voiced their opinions and thoughts on the current situation of the world and more specifically the United States.Bono, current front man of pop-sensation U2, has been one of the few active celebrities to recently speak out in favor of the war."" I am all for President Bush scaring the sh- out of Sadaam Hussein, but you have to bring along the rest of the world,"" he said.What he's referring to is the ultimatum that President Bush gave the Iraqi president, an ultimatum that defied the wishes of much of the world, including the U.N. Security Council. This decision led a large majority of the global community to condemn the United States brazen use of force.Celebrities are poping up all over the place voicing opposition to the war effert, one of which is rap artist Sean ""P-diddy"" Combs.""I'm totally against the war in Iraq,"" Combs said. ""I've been praying this day wouldn't happen. My prayers go out to the innocent lives being lost in Iraq. We have it good; they're not invading America.""This statement rings all too true, for most individuals thinking how lucky they are with the ability to go on with life as normal.""People should not be too scared and carry on with business as usual,"" said rapper/actor Method Man.One thing Bush's administration has made abundantly clear is that this is an effort to liberate Iraq and not to occupy it.Media mogul Russell Simmons said he hopes ""President Bush will make good on his promise to liberate the people of Iraq.""According to MTV.com, other musicians, like The Beastie Boys and System of a Down, are using their songs to get their opinions out and have no plans on slowing down.""We have the opportunity of putting a song out there that people around the world are going to hear,"" Mike D said. ""And I think it's important for people around the world to hear what the people's views are, because I think right now they're probably just mostly reading headlines and seeing in the newspapers what President Bush's ideas are and what his mission is and what his agenda is without seeing where a lot of the opinion lies, which is quite different than that.""Beastie Boys's frontman Mike D said when asked on the groups new song ""In a World Gone Mad"" opposing Bush's plans.In many cases, such as with System of a Down, artists do not intend to write protest songs, they just come out. Musicians tend to write about personal things, and to songwriters like System's Daron Malakian, who has family in Iraq, war is personal.""We're not trying to point fingers or anything, but there's a lot of unjust feelings and sadness in the world, and personally, in my writing, a lot of that is coming out in a very frantic way,"" the guitarist said. ""I can't explain it. It's definitely influential times to live in, and that's why it frustrates me to see some cheese balls coming out there and saying absolutely nothing with their music.""Here at Sam Houston students also jumped to voice their opinions when asked what their thoughts are regarding celebrities using their profession to promote their political views.""It's expected,"" said graduate student Jesse Saldana, ""They're hogs of the limelight and will use every opportunity to voice their opinions. It's appropriate to a certain degree, it's their job.""Senior Sarah True was more understanding of the celebrities position.""If I had status or an audience, I'd speak my mind.,"" True said.Still other studetns said they think many celebrities take unfair advantage of their star power.""They (celebrities) are taking advantage of their influence just because they're famous,"" sophomore Paige Pollack said. ""We're being forced to hear them. I mean, they have that right too, I'm just sick of hearing what they think, who cares?""Included with many others around campus senior Mona Avalos said she feels these celebrities are getting too much attention.""We have free speech and they use it on formats that are viewed by impressionable minds,"" Avalos said. ""They should attempt a little more respect for our president. Like the Dixie Chicks, talking smack and then trying to retract their publicly stated opinion, what's that?""Perhaps senior Jerry 'Wally' Wallace summed it up best.""I don't think any of them would even have the opportunity, money or freedom to voice their opinion if it wasn't for the United States."""
College of Education and Applied Science on probation,Houstonian: Sam Houston State University,"January 1, 1970 Thursday","""The first stage is the preparation of the reports from the different departments, or subject areas. Those will be due by September,"" Merchant said. ""Then the other institutional report is due the following summer, before their visit in the fall.""NCATE found a variety of ""weaknesses"" when they sent a board of examiners to SHSU in March of 2001. Under Category I.A (Conceptual Framework) of the report, NCATE decided, ""The conceptual framework is not articulated and shared among the professional education faculty, candidates, and other members of the professional community.""According to Merchant, Conceptual Framework is the underlying structure of a professional education unit that gives meaning to the whole structure of all the programs within the unit, or, in other words, the overall view.The next ""weakness"" came in Category 1.C which stated, ""Content studies do not consistently prepare candidates to attain academic competence in the content they teach.""Where that comes from, said Merchant, is that each content field has to prepare a program and send it to its national organization. ""For example, for someone in math ed., preparing math teachers, they want to submit their program to the National Council of Teachers of Math and then describe it and get approval,"" Merchant said. ""NCATE then comes in and takes a look and asks, 'How did each of your programs do?' We had several that were fine, in fact we had exemplary in some, but we had several that did not pass the standard by their national organization."" Merchant said SHSU's early childhood did not pass along with two to three other areas.Another ""weakness"" came in Category II.C, with NCATE reporting, ""The unit does not ensure appropriate academic and professional advisement.""""That is one we need to work on,"" said Merchant.SHSU early education major, Katie Berryhill agrees. ""They (advisors) are never 100 percent sure,"" Berryhill said.To fix the problem, one plan in the works is to devise one major office for all advisement.""It'll be for students anywhere on campus that are working for teacher certification,"" Merchant said. ""We may have some clerical type people, who are trained to do advisement unless there's a major problem. And they certainly could handle all the paperwork that goes with itthat's what bogs down our faculty so much.""Another weakness in the report, connected with the advisement problem, stated, ""Excessive workload assignments for faculty impact the effectiveness of advising and service.""""You have to understand our program has changed,"" Merchant said in explanation. ""Where we used to primarily deal with undergraduate students who were here on campus all the time, we are now offering complete certification programs in The Woodlands. ""We have also moved a lot of our field courses, so the students, even in their junior year, are out there in a school, elementary, secondary, or something. And our faculty is driving out there and actually teaching some of those undergraduate courses on the sites so the students don't have to come in, he said. ""That really takes a lot away from faculty members' time if they are on the road two hours to get there, teach a class, and then take another two hours to get back.""To fix the problem, Merchant said they are looking into lessening the load of faculty members who have to travel off campus to teach.Rounding out the ""weaknesses"" was in Category IV.B, ""The unit lacks adequate resources to support faculty travel, research, grant writing, and ongoing professional development.""According to Merchant that is a problem issue.""When they looked at what we were spending for our support for faculty travel and support for faculty development, they didn't think that was enough,"" Merchant said. ""So we're probably going to have to beef up financial resources to support faculty.""In the next two to three weeks, Merchant said he'd be coming up with a budget to correct all the ""weaknesses."" Merchant took over as Dean of the College of Education and Applied Science Nov. 16, 2001 after Dr. Tom Wood, the college's former dean, was injured in a bicycle accident.SHSU has been accredited by NCATE since 1957, and is one of 10 schools in Texas with the title. Among them, the University of Houston is also on probation."
Prison Labor,Houstonian: Sam Houston State University,"January 1, 1970 Thursday","They make and market flags, garments, stainless steel and metal products, bedding, detergents, cardboard boxes, first aid products and park equipment. In fiscal year 2000, SHSU bought $92,974.09 worth of TCI goods and services. So far this year, SHSU has purchased $38,522.05 from TCI, according to Frank Krystyniak, SHSU public relations department.Why should you care? Maybe by TCI being the lowest bidder, your tuition and fees increases wont be astronomical. Or, the university can offer more classes or services. Or, building renovations can continue on schedule. ""The products and services produced are quite valuable to the governmental entities that are able to use them. The work that they are able to do on school buses and fire trucks allows local governments and school districts to better maintain their rolling capital stock and at prices that make repairs, rather than replacement, economical,"" Huntsville Mayor and university professor Bill Green said.Last but by no means least, an inmates life may be in the process of being changed for the better.Inmates here pose no dangerTCIs most valuable service for SHSU is its asbestos removal program. This work can only be done under the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administrations strict guidelines from start to finish. The inmates are instructed and certified in asbestos removal through classes at TDCJ. The inmates on the asbestos crews have achieved trustee status, Jack Parker, vice president of Finance and Operations stated.Did you ever wonder about the fencing around the buildings being renovated? Yes, it is there to keep the university community out of harms way during demolition and construction. But, it is also there, and padlocked, to keep the Texas Correctional Industries inmates confined (to their work area). ""Theyre inside the building. We dont let them stroll around campus,"" Parker said, adding that access to a work site is controlled by inmate identification and prison guards on-site. ""They were here about six months. They razed the entire interior of this building [the Administration Building]. They saved us a lot of money.""The Administration Building and Estill asbestos removals were done for between $80,000-$90,000. This was ""51 percent of what it would have cost"" if done by a commercial company, Parker noted.At the Gibbs Ranch, the SHSU agricultural complex, SHSU supplied the materials for TCI to build fences and clear brush from the right of ways.The inmates do not get paid for work they do for TCI. The state looks at it as the inmates are being taught employable skills, in the hopes the inmates will find work, which will keep them from returning to the prison system.TCI industries throughout TexasTexas Correctional Industries was created by the state legislature in 1968. The legislatures intent was that job training and experience gained by inmates would combat Texas high 48 percent recidivism rate for 1991, according to Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts Texas Performance Review, Public Safety and Corrections Issues, 1996. The rate is measured by the number of inmates reincarcerated within three years of their initial release. The hallway room identification signs with Braille marking in the Administration Building are by TCI, as are most of the exterior and interior signs and stickers for SHSU, including evacuation route signage in case of a fire. Your dorm furniture, classroom chair, computer lab desks, steel file cabinets and cleaning materials are TCI products.""The furniture products they produce for state and local government are of high quality and are affordable. Having these products available for state and local governments reduces the cost to taxpayers,"" said Green.A November 1997 state audit report showed TCI had an inventory of $24.2 million.Local schools take old computersWhen Computer Services can no longer work its magic on computers and peripheral equipment, it is donated to TCIs Computer Recovery Program located in the Wynne Unit. When reconditioned by inmates, the computers are donated to public school systems, like HISD. This cuts the cost for the schools, while the inmates learn a marketable skill to make them gainfully employable upon completion of their sentences.Parker said he was informed TCI had a moratorium on computer donations, leaving Computer Services to warehouse equipment declared ""surplus,"" or unusable.The Computer Recovery service was called last week about private donations. They said private computer donations must go to a school/business in the Computer Recovery Program; the school would send the equipment to the unit. If you have ""broken"" computer equipment sitting around and taking up space, you might call your local middle or high school, and ask if they belong to this program.All TCI products and services are only available to ""agencies of the state, political subdivisions of the state (like universities or other state agencies), current employees of TDCJ, current members of the state legislature, another state, the federal government, a foreign government, or an agency of any of those governments,"" according to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice web site www.http://tdcj.state.tx.us/faq-tci.htm.Incarceration costsJohn Benestante is the TDCJ director for industry. His figures for TCIs ""War Against Recidivism"" program show it costs taxpayers $39,000 per year to house an ""offender.""TCI has a job employment program to help offenders find work before they are released. Parolees can also work with the Texas Workforce Commission. Companies hiring parolees get financial help from the state, such as tax incentives and a federally-supported bonding program to protect the hiring employer.Every state penal system has some form of marketable industry. Research found some prisoners rights groups are advocating unions for prison laborers. Also, in some states, commercial business interests are against prison industries because of the competition.TCI belongs to the Correctional Industries Association in Baltimore. They exhibit at prison industries trade shows, such as the one put on by The American Correctional Association.For more information on Texas Correctional Industries, call the Texas Department of Criminal Justice or visit the web site,   www.unx1.shsu.edu/-stdcxv12/TCIWebsite/indexProductSales.htm."
Truth class: X delivers message,Houstonian: Sam Houston State University,"January 1, 1970 Thursday","""They bear the burden of what their ancestors did, and they are accountable to repair it,"" he said. ""They have a duty to stop the madness.""Quanell X presented his views on reparations, and said that white people owe black people more than they have given them in the past.""I've had many black Americans be angry with me because of my position on reparations,"" he said. ""We should not be given reparations in the form of individual checks. If the white people give the black people a check, the white people would get it back the next day.""Quanell X said reparations should be used for people coming out of prison without jobs, helping to find a cure for AIDS, and ensuring proper health care for black people.""Reparations should be used to produce better services for us as a people, not as individuals.""Quanell X said white people have paid reparations to Jewish, Indians, Japanese-Americans. However, he said white people owe black people 400 years of reparations, beginning in 1555 with the first slave trade until 1955 when African-Americans were still fighting for civil rights.""The whites have gunned down black leaders, and white people in office went into every black organization and assassinated all the black leaders with their character and with their lives,"" he said. ""Night riders in the south lynched black people, and white people bombed the 16th Street Baptist Church and killed innocent children, and no one was arrested for this for years. You have been terrorists in this nation to black people.""You don't mind if black people kill each other in the hood, but when they start to kill white people you tell them to love everyone,"" Quanell X said. ""We wouldn't need Affirmative Action if we got reparations.""Quanell X also presented his views on Affirmative Action, and how it affects the African-American community and the way minorities seek higher education.""I am not a supporter of Affirmative Action,"" he said. ""Affirmative Action is not the answer, it's a Band-Aid on cancer.""He said there are too many black schools that need more bright black minds.""We should not fight white people so that we can go to school with them,"" he said. ""We can make our own decent, respectable, meaningful places for education.""Don't come to our black high schools seeking our black athletes,"" he said. ""Let these white folks see what it's like to have all white baseball, basketball, and football teams. They would never win the NCAA again. Maybe the black athletes here should get out of SHSU and go to one of our own schools.""Quanell X also opposed the idea of a U.S. war with Iraq. He said America is sending poor white, black and Hispanic people to fight in the war instead of sending the children of the rich. He said America's main motive is to have control of everything, not to preserve our government.""Bush was not elected by a popular vote, he was elected by the Supreme Court. How can they tell you your vote really counts?"" he said. ""For all the white people that are listening, your nation is going straight to hell. America's arrogance and egotistical pride will bring her down. She is like Babylon, and believes no one will harm her.""The people in the Middle East don't hate American citizens, they hate the government. Notice that during the events of Sept. 11, no planes went into Harlem and no Anthrax letters made it to the ghetto.""He also said white people need to get used to the fact that they will not be the majority much longer.""The world is becoming increasingly black and brown,"" he said. ""In less than 25 years, we will be the majority. If black people ever came to power in America, we would not do to you what your ancestors did to us.""He also urged African-Americans to organize their own facilities.""We as black people must organize for ourselves,"" he said. ""Asian-Americans don't have problems in the United States because every city has a China Town. We need to build something for ourselves.""During his speech Quanell X also spoke on religion, and said people who have faith in God and love Jesus should realize that Jesus was black. He referred to the book of Revelations in the Bible where it states that Jesus had hair of lamb's wool and his eyes burned.""Jesus himself was a black man,"" he said. ""Don't tell me his skin was olive. If it's burnt, it's black, baby.""He also referred to Jesus' mother Mary's lineage from Egypt.""How can Jesus have a mother from Egypt and be white with long, blonde hair? That's white supremacy in religion.""Quanell X thanked the people who worked to bring him to SHSU, and also addressed those that opposed him.""I just want to thank all of you who worked tirelessly to make sure this would be a successful event,"" he said. ""For those of you who oppose me, I thank you too. I love you, and I respect you. Why wouldn't you want me to come to your campus? If it's God's will for me to be here, you don't have the power to keep me away.""I don't understand how you can bring other speakers to this campus who have nothing to offer this university. Those people are only allowed to come and speak because white people approve them to come here.""He also urged African-Americans to come together and be proud of their heritage.""Black people, we need to be honest with ourselves and stop playing games. We can't ask anyone to respect us if we don't respect ourselves,"" he said. ""You can never become a better person if you don't change the way you think. Don't be ashamed of having big lips and a broad nose, because that is how God made you. You're not black because you're cursed, you're black because you're first.""Some students who attended the speech voiced their opinions about the events of the evening.Sophomore Tice Bain stood outside the Lowman Student Center with a large sign that read, ""Do Not Support Racism.""""I want people to listen to the speech but not believe what is said,"" Bain said.""I don't think the Black Panthers are any better than the Ku Klux Klan or the Neo-Nazis,"" freshman Matt Elliot said. ""They're just another hate group. They take the truth and put a twist on it, forcing it to validate their cause. Martin Luther King, Jr. had the right idea, and that idea is that a Christian learns to love, not hate.""Others wished Quanell X had offered more solutions to the problems he addressed.""Anyone can rant and rave about the problems of the world. However, it takes real men and women to solve them and Mr. X offered no solutions,"" freshman Kyle Volkmer said. ""In the 1960s, the Black Panthers really seemed to have a cause, and now it seems like the blind are leading the blind.""I can sum up my beliefs in a song. 'Red and yellow, black and white, they are precious in his sight. Jesus loves the little children of the world.'"""
The faces of Dublin's homeless,The University Times: Trinity College,"January 1, 1970 Thursday","It is said that ignorance breeds contempt in this world. If this statement is true there must be a flipside: that awareness creates respect.The homeless on the streets of Dublin are a passive fixture to most; like the Jim Larkin statue on O'Connell Street or Phil Lynott off Grafton Street. We pass these often familiar faces, cocooned in layers of sleeping bags and clutching coffee cups outside Spar, on the Hal' penny Bridge or around Temple Bar. After living in rural Co.Wexford most of my life I was shocked at the level of homelessness on Dublin's Streets. Above all, I was intrigued by them. I wanted to find out where they came from, what led them to the streets in the first place, were they previously employed, were they angry and to know if they had hope for the future. What are their stories?Uris""No money, no vodka, no girl!"" Uris, 47, tells me quite cheerfully on a cold afternoon on Dame Street when I ask how he's doing. Originally from Latvia, he had a fall recently and broke his leg but he appreciates the help he is getting from St. James' Hospital. Despite the awkwardness of his current state on crutches he still has the good humour to joke about the morphine tablets he receives from the hospital! He also attends the Homeless Persons Unit on Gardiner Street, showing some papers he had stamped detailing his record there. His family are home in Latvia but he does not see them much. Uris was delighted to have his photo taken and to give his account of what surely is a lonely life for him.DavidDavid, from England, has been homeless for four years. When asked what lead him to take up life on the streets he laughs. ""Drinking and fighting. I was in trouble with the police ages ago and I got chucked out of everywhere! But I've been good so far."" Tales of the hardy bucks' antics spring to mind, but David also threw in his tuppence worth about the government services for the homeless in Ireland. Like many, he does not go near the shelters because ""you get your phone taken off you. If you take your shoes and socks off they will go too!"" He acknowledged that it was hard at the moment. David said that it would cost him (EURO)50 for two nights' accommodation but today he's only made (EURO)20. He had an interesting anecdote regarding the hostels. ""One of the lads, he got chucked out last night, so a woman got in his room instead. Men are not allowed to go in the women's room and the women are not allowed go into the men's room. But, the person that was on [duty] put her in with us, so we all went downstairs and complained!"" David explained and laughed that ""then we all got chucked out ourselves!"" David is adamant he will not be on the streets much longer. He will have a job sorted with a friend's daughter and it will pay his hostel for the week. David is a father himself and laughs about his daughters ringing him up everyday looking for money which he never has! However he is grateful for having family, something many of the homeless have lost touch with, and states that he'll try to make it home to them for Christmas.Austin""People think it's easy to sit down and put your hand out, but it's so degrading. Five or ten years ago I would never have dreamt for one minute that I would be sitting on the street."" Austin was born in Ireland, lived in England and is back again now. He has been homeless for six months now. A former drug dealer, he had to leave England after being shot in the back with a sawn off shotgun. He cannot return or he will be killed he says. Together, Austin and his 'street brother' Carl look out for each other and do their best to avoid being robbed. Austin says he sleeps with his money in his socks and the best way to get through these cold nights is to find as many sleeping bags as you can. What Austin really wants is a chance to work again and support himself. He is a trained chef, but needs to get off the streets in order to secure employment. Austin is also tired having to put up with people's sniping comments. ""Sit down and talk to me and I guarantee you, you'll have a different view,"" stated Austin. His friend Carl claims ""we're just figures on the street, just a percentage. This is the most embarrassing thing you can ever do.""AllenAllen has been homeless for five years. He is an emotional character. ""Life is more down than up,"" he says, ""but you just get on with it."" Allen was employed before, and would gladly work again, but with no fixed abode he cannot get a job. The housing situation is a contentious issue for many homeless. Allen moves around throughout the day. According to Allen the only place he cannot sit is at the ATM machines. He says you'll be 'nicked' straight away by the Gardaí for that. He says you can get to know some of the shop security lads; when they come out for a smoke you can chat with them. This is often his only form of social interaction. Allen stays away from the homeless hostels. He is not comfortable with the 'other people' there.Michael, Martin and John are three homeless characters around Temple Bar. John came to Ireland from Leeds with some travellers who were kind to him and gave him work. However, John is an alcoholic and this has diminished his chances of employment. He says, contrary to the beliefs of other homeless, the facilities here in Ireland are far superior to those in England. John believes that it's much easier to get a proper meal here and a roof of over your head. He also finds the people in Ireland much more giving and kind. Leaving for Leeds soon, John says he will be sad to leave his friends behind but that he will never forget them. John, Martin and Michael mind each other and help make it through each day together. They are a fine example of the solidarity that can be found on the streets and which is critical for their survival.Trinity Vincent de Paul has been working with the homeless for years. Recently I took part in their soup run. Other students said they find the work very rewarding and that it is great to meet and talk with the homeless as they are usually very friendly. One homeless lady I met on Westmoreland Street was very grateful of the soup and sandwiches from the VDP. She appreciated her situation saying that she was much better off than a lot of homeless who were ""too old to be out"" and that knowledge gets her through each cold night.The soup run sets off every Tuesday and Friday night from Teach Mhuire on Gardiner Street. This is a transitional residential home for alcoholics and drug addicts who were once homeless. There are several more of these dotted around the country; they house up to 600 collectively. They have been very successful in helping addicts reform and get back some quality of living. Louisa Miller, Activities Officer for the Trinity VDP, recounted the stories of a few of the people involved with Teach Mhuire that have turned their lives around. Kenny, 22, had his past marred by death in his family. As a solution he subsequently turned to alcohol and ended up homeless. With the aid of Teach Mhuire, he is now a changed man, involved with drama productions in Teach Mhuire and getting his life back on track. Dave is another young man who has reformed and is now studying social care in college.One of the great characters involved with the VDP and the soup run is Pat. Pat was on and off the streets for twenty years and also battled with alcoholism but now claims he is happier than he has ever been in his life. He is beacon of hope for many on the streets. He talks to the homeless on the soup runs and assures them that they can turn their lives around, that life does not always have to be a torment and struggle sleeping in a doorway or fighting addiction.The homeless have revealed that it is strikingly easy to fall by the wayside in society and brutally difficult to fight your way back. However, it is always possible to include everyone in a community, no matter their circumstances. We can become more aware of the homeless if we engage with them, perhaps get involved with a charity or even just have a casual conversation with them. Ultimately, it is reasonable of them to ask for this respect and it is enlight"
"""The Wiz"" opens next week",Houstonian: Sam Houston State University,"January 1, 1970 Thursday","She said there are more characters and some have different names. Also, it is more chronological and has more audience appeal, because the play is a dazzle of dance, color and artistry.""The production [is] created for the enjoyment of all ages,"" Alondra Andrews, cast member, said.The all African American cast and crew, made up of 40 or 45 people, have been practicing since early February.

Professor promotes restorative justice,Houstonian: Sam Houston State University,"January 1, 1970 Thursday","A kidnapping-turned rape-turned murder prematurely ended her life.It was an all too tragic end. White wept. So did many others, including Cathy's young daughter, Ami.But when the tears were calmed, there was a transformation. LindaWhite played her trump card.Following her daughter's death, White's life dramatically changed. She adopted her then granddaughter and raised her as ""daughter."" Then, the questions really began.Because so many questions regarding her daughter's death were unanswered, White took an interest in her daughter's killers. What had happened the day Cathy died? Why was she targeted? Why had the men resorted to death?""Crime is not black and white,"" said White. To find answers to her questions, she would have to find them herself. A self-motivated study of psychology proved solacing. White began to understand things that previously puzzled her. The study turned into a passion.""I found the most helpful thing was reading about loss and griefit helped to normalize my experience and that of my family,"" said White. ""It also gave me something over which I had some control. We were so involved with the justice system all the time that I felt I lived in limbo, just waiting for the system to do its work.""White had never finished the college career she once began, but her studies led her back there. Ultimately, her passion was rewarded, in the form of a Ph.D. Years of intense study were impressive, but White wanted more.""You can be a victim of violent crime and not want to strike back in a violent way. You can reach out for something better,"" White said.A New Way to CopeWhite did just that. Her ""something better"" was an aim to promote ""restorative justice.""Restorative justice is a systematic approach to ""restore"" both victims and offenders of violent crime to a state of stability. Unlike textbook punishment, restorative justice emphasizes healing the wounds of victims, offenders and communities caused by crime. Basically, restorative justice seeks to address harm without doing further harm.""Our present system addresses harm, but often does more in the process,"" said White of Texas prisons. The State of Texas recently implemented restorative justice programs in the prison system. In one such program, White met with her daughter's killer in an inaugural Texas Department of Criminal Justice Mediation Program. During a series of groundbreaking face-to-face mediation sessions, White and Ami were able to confront one of Cathy's killers.After the session, White saw her daughter's killer was remorseful, but little was being done within the prison system to ""restore"" the offender. Through the mediation, the offender understood the consequences of his actions. Understanding, contends White, will lead to reduced recidivism: reduced recidivism equals reduced crime.This was White's simple equation to an effective sentence, and theState of Texas seemed to feel this way too. The state's ""straight punishment"" policy has been altered a bit and TDCJ now offers a Victim Offender Mediation/Dialogue (VOM/D) program.""If I believed punishment worked, then maybe I'd see it justifiable.But I don't. There are great limitations on what punishment can do positively,"" said White.White feels it's ""just too easy to serve a passive prison sentence.""She feels her mediation was effective because the offender's participation forced him into ""admitting guilt and accepting responsibility.""Giving BackWhite believes so strongly in restorative justice that she stays involved with many programs that promote it. Besides teaching, she is a member of Bridges to Life (a victim/offender encounter program), Murder Victims' Families for Reconciliation, New Directions (a treatment center serving ex-offenders) and serves as a mediator with the Victim Offender Mediation/Dialogue.White is an adjunct professor of psychology at SHSU and teaches philosophy and psychology classes at three area prison units.""I guess I'm somewhat of a classical educator,"" admits White. ""I believe teaching is about making a life as well as a living.""White's busy lifestyle all centers around furthering the idea of non-violence.""We [society] say that we decry violence but we consistently respond with violence in countless sectors of our society. I think one of the saddest, and most violent, aspects of our culture is how little we actually seem to care about one anotherhow uncivil we've become.""White found her winning hand.""All the things I do are an effort to do something constructive about violence,"" said White. She said she does not see herself being ""the source of more pain"" for others.""There's already enough pain in the world."""
